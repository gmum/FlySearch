However, it's been resized to (32, 32) pixels.\n        You can ask for specific parts of the image in larger resolution by specifying (x, y) coordinates of the top-left \n        and bottom-right corners of the rectangle you want to see. Said rectangle will also be resized to (32, 32) pixels\n        so the larger it is, the less detailed it will be. \n        \n        For example, if you want to see the top-left corner of the image, you can specify (0, 0) and (0.25, 0.25) as the corners.        \n        Of course, you can also go wild and specify coordinates like (0.13, 0.72) and (0.45, 0.89) to see a different part of the image.\n                        \n        Using the same format, please specify the coordinates of the next rectangle you want to see or choose to classify the image.\n        DO NOT WRITE ANYTHING ELSE THAN THE COORDINATES OR YOUR CLASSIFICATION GUESS. \n        \n        Classify when you're reasonably certain about the specific Imagenet class. Note that there are many classes that mamy seem similar, so you need to be very precise.\n                        \n        You can request at most 5 glimpses.\n        \n        OUTPUT FORMAT: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) OR CLASSIFICATION: <your guess>\n    \n\n(0.0, 0.0) and (0.5, 0.5)\n\n\n(0.5, 0.0) and (1.0, 0.5)\n\n\n\n(0.0, 0.5) and (0.5, 1.0)\n\n\n\n\n(0.5, 0.5) and (1.0, 1.0)\n\n\n\n\n\nCLASSIFICATION: miniature_schnauzer"
