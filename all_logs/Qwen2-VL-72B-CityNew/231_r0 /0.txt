<Reasoning>Given the aerial view, I observe several rooftops with typical urban elements such as HVAC units, vents, and other structural features. The anomaly may not be immediately visible, so I should start by lowering my altitude to get a closer look. Reducing altitude will provide a more detailed view and might reveal the anomaly without moving too far from the current position. If the anomaly is not found in this immediate area, I can adjust my position accordingly in subsequent moves.</Reasoning>
