<Reasoning>Upon descending closer to the rooftop, I am now observing a clearer view of the concrete and metal structures that are typical of a building's exterior. The anomaly I am searching for may not be visible from this angle or position. To continue the search, I will move slightly to the right while descending further, aiming to get a better look at different sections of the rooftop that might contain the anomaly.</Reasoning>
