<Reasoning>Having moved to the right, the current view reveals a cluster of objects that appear to be pieces of wood and other debris. This could potentially be the anomaly I am searching for. To confirm, I need to get closer and descend to a lower altitude to inspect these objects more closely. I will now move to a position directly above these objects and lower my altitude to determine if they indeed represent the anomaly.</Reasoning>
