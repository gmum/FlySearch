<Reasoning>Having descended closer to the objects on the rooftop, it's clear that the cluster of wood and other debris is the anomaly I've been tasked to locate. The objects are now in my field of view, and I am within the 10 meters altitude requirement above the objects, which is necessary for a successful identification. Therefore, I can conclude the search and communicate that I have found the anomaly.</Reasoning>
