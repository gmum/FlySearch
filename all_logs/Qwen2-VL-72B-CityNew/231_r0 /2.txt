<Reasoning>As I descend further, the details on the rooftop become clearer. I notice the HVAC units and other mechanical equipment, which are typical for a building's rooftop infrastructure. The anomaly might be more easily identifiable if I get closer to the ground, where objects stand out more prominently. Moving slightly to the left and down should bring me closer to the potential anomaly, allowing for a detailed inspection.</Reasoning>
