<Reasoning>Having descended closer to the rooftop, I now have a more detailed view of the area. I notice a variety of objects, including large HVAC units, pipes, and other common rooftop installations. To find the anomaly, I should make a careful examination of these features. Moving slightly to the right and downward could bring me closer to the anomaly if it's on this part of the rooftop. If not, I will continue to search in the next move.</Reasoning>
