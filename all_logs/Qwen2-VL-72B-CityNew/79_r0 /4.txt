<Reasoning>Upon descending to 10 meters above ground level, I can confirm that the object in view is indeed the large trash pile I have been searching for. It is centered in my field of view, and I am at the required altitude of 10 meters or less above it. Therefore, I can now report that I have found the object.</Reasoning>
