<Reasoning>Currently, I'm at an altitude of 77 meters, which is too high to identify the road construction site. I need to descend closer to the ground to get a better view. I will move towards the center of the grid, slightly south and down, to get a clearer image of the area that may contain the construction site.</Reasoning>
