<Reasoning>Since I am currently at a high altitude of 60 meters, I should descend closer to the surface to search for the anomaly more effectively. I will move directly downwards to reduce my altitude and get closer to the ground level. This will allow me to observe potential anomalies at a closer range and identify the one that stands out.</Reasoning>
