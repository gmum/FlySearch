<Reasoning>At this altitude, I am still relatively high above the ground. To get a closer view of the objects below, I need to descend further. I will move downwards to reduce my altitude to 10 meters, which will allow me to observe the objects at a closer range and identify the anomaly more clearly.</Reasoning>
