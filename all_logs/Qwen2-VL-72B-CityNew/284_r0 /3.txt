<Reasoning>At this altitude, I can see a green car parked on the street. To determine if this is the anomaly, I need to observe the surrounding objects and compare them. I will move closer to the car by moving to the coordinates (0, 0, -3) to get a detailed view of the car and its surroundings. This will allow me to identify any unusual features or characteristics that may indicate an anomaly.</Reasoning>
