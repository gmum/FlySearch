<Reasoning>At this altitude, I have a clear view of the car, and it appears to be the anomaly since it stands out from the surrounding environment. The car is not expected to be there, and it is the only object that doesn't fit in with the rest of the scene. I am currently centered on the car and at a distance of less than 10 meters, so I can confidently report that I have found the anomaly.</Reasoning>
