<Reasoning>At this altitude, I can see several objects below, including a green car and what appears to be a water tank on the rooftop. To determine which one is the anomaly, I need to get a closer look by moving downwards and observing their details. I will move to the coordinates (0, 0, -5) to get a better view of the objects and identify the one that stands out.</Reasoning>
