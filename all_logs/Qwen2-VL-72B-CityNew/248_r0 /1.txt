<Reasoning>Approaching the object too closely may cause an emergency stop due to potential collision. I will fly back to a safer distance and then descend closer to the ground to continue the search. I will move towards (-17, 0) and descend to an altitude of -15 meters to avoid hitting any obstacles while still maintaining a clear view of the ground.</Reasoning>
