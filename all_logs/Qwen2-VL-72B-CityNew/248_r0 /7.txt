<Reasoning>Upon examining the current image, I notice a small object on the ground near the coordinates (-1, 1). This could be the anomaly I am searching for. To confirm, I need to fly closer and observe it from a lower altitude. I will move towards the coordinates (-1, 1) and descend to an altitude of 1 meter to inspect the object closely.</Reasoning>
