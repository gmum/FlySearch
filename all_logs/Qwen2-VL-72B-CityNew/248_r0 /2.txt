<Reasoning>It seems I have hit an obstacle while trying to get closer to the ground. I will move back to a safer distance and then lower my altitude gradually to avoid any further collisions. I will move to the coordinates (-17, 0) and then lower my altitude to -10 meters to get a better view of the ground while maintaining a safe distance from the buildings.</Reasoning>
