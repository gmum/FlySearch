<Reasoning>Based on the current image, it appears that the anomaly is located at coordinates (1, -1). To confirm, I will move towards this location while maintaining a safe altitude of 1 meter above ground level. This will allow me to get a closer look at the anomaly and verify its identity.</Reasoning>
