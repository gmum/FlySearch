<Reasoning>I am currently centered on the road, with the anomaly (the yellow car) visible. I need to move closer to it to verify that it is the anomaly. I will move towards the yellow car, which is located at coordinates (0, -7), while maintaining a safe altitude of 1 meter above the ground.</Reasoning>
