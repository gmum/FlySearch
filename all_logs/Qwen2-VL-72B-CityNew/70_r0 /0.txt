<Reasoning>There is no sign of fire in the current view. I will move to a position that offers a broader perspective and closer to where the fire could potentially be. The coordinates (-23, 23) seem to offer a position that could potentially reveal more of the area below and might be closer to the object in question.</Reasoning>
