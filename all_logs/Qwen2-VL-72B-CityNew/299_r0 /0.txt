<Reasoning>From this aerial view, I notice a uniform pattern of roads and buildings. To find an anomaly, I should focus on areas with irregularities or areas that break the uniform pattern. The yellow points on the road could be potential anomalies, but I need to get closer and confirm. I will move towards one of these points.</Reasoning>
