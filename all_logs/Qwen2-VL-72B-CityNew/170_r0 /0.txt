<Reasoning>Since the objective is to find a crowd and possibly lower my altitude to below 10 meters relative to the crowd, I should move downwards first to reduce my overall height and then consider moving horizontally to search for the crowd. A significant crowd might be located in the open space, which seems to be towards the south-east. I will move down to check if the crowd is in the immediate vicinity and then adjust my position.</Reasoning>
