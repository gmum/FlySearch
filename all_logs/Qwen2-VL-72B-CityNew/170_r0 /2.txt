<Reasoning>Now that I am at a lower altitude, I can see more details on the ground. There are no obvious crowds in the immediate vicinity, so I will continue my search by flying further east and slightly north, staying low to stay within the 10-meter requirement. This will allow me to scan a broader area for any potential crowds.</Reasoning>
