<Reasoning>Having moved down, I am now lower and can observe more details on the ground. There's a visible open area and a few people on the street, but I need to check if there is a larger crowd. I will move slightly northward and eastward to a point that can provide a better view of the area, avoiding obstacles such as buildings. This will allow me to check for more people, potentially finding the crowd.</Reasoning>
