<Reasoning>The object appears to be a crowd of people located towards the top of the current field of view. To get closer and confirm, I need to move directly towards it and descend. The crowd is centered around the coordinates (11, 22), so I will aim for that point while also descending to a lower altitude to ensure I am within the required range of 10 meters or less above the object.</Reasoning>
