<Reasoning>Found the object in question. It is located near the center of the image. I am currently at a safe altitude to approach it and get a better view.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Now that I have found the object, I will fly below 10 meters to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Lowering the drone height to 7 meters will provide a better view of the object without hitting anything. I will move the drone to the center of the image to get a clear view of the object.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Now that the drone is in the center of the image and below 10 meters, I can confirm that I have found the object in question.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>FOUND</Reasoning>
