<Reasoning>At an altitude of 41 meters, I can now clearly see the construction site, which is centered around the coordinates (0, 0). To ensure I am at the correct altitude to observe the construction site closely, I will slightly decrease my altitude by an additional 2 meters to ensure I am within 10 meters of the construction site.</Reasoning>
