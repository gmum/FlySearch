<Reasoning>There are no visible objects that stand out in the current view. The area appears to be a typical urban environment with buildings and roads. I should descend closer to the ground to get a better view of potential anomalies. I will move to the coordinates (-64, 0) which is to the left of my current position to explore a different area.</Reasoning>
