<Reasoning>Having moved closer to the ground, I'll continue my descent to further reduce my altitude, aiming to be within 10 meters of any potential anomaly. This will ensure I have a closer and clearer view, enabling a more precise identification of the object. I will also slightly shift my position to the northeast to explore this quadrant more closely, as it appears less obstructed by buildings and may reveal the anomaly.</Reasoning>
