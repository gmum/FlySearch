<Reasoning>Based on the current image, I am still looking down at what appears to be a wall or a structure, without any visible signs of a road construction site. Given that there have been multiple emergency stops due to proximity to obstacles, it's clear that moving in this direction is not a safe or productive approach. To find the road construction site, I need to maneuver away from the current location and attempt to reorient myself or find a clearer path. Moving north should help avoid further collisions and potentially reveal a new area that could contain the construction site.</Reasoning>
