<Reasoning>With the current image, I'm still not seeing any indications of a road construction site. The buildings and roads are fairly normal, with no signs of construction work. I need to further lower my altitude to potentially spot any construction zones that might be hidden among the buildings. I will move further south to inspect a new area.</Reasoning>
