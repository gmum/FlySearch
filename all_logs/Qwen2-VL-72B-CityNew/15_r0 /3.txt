<Reasoning>The current image shows a close-up view of what seems to be a roof or a wall, with no signs of a road construction site. I have flown too close and risked hitting an obstacle. To avoid further collisions, I need to raise my altitude slightly and continue the search from a safer distance. I will move back to the right to clear any potential obstacles and maintain a safe flying path.</Reasoning>
