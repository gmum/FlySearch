<Reasoning>Upon descending to the current altitude, I can confirm that the red vehicle observed earlier is part of a road construction site. The presence of construction materials and equipment around the vehicle supports this conclusion. Given that I am now within the required altitude range of 10 meters or less above the object and have a clear view of the construction site, I am in a position to accurately identify the object as per the objective. It is crucial to provide a precise response indicating the successful identification to ensure that the mission is accomplished effectively.</Reasoning>
