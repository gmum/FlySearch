<Reasoning>From the current view, we can observe an area with a distinctive red vehicle parked near the bottom right of the image, which might be indicative of a construction site, as such vehicles are often associated with construction work. To confirm if this is indeed the construction site, I need to lower the drone's altitude to get a closer look and ensure that I am in line with the object. This will help me verify if the red vehicle is part of the construction activities and whether the area fulfills the requirements of being the targeted road construction site.</Reasoning>
