<Reasoning>Returning to a higher altitude after several emergency stops suggests that I need to reassess my search strategy. The current view does not provide any clear signs of a road construction site, and my previous attempts to move closer to the ground have been unsuccessful and unsafe. To avoid further risks and continue the search effectively, I should maintain a safe altitude and explore new areas. Moving east will provide a different perspective and may reveal new information about the location of the construction site.</Reasoning>
