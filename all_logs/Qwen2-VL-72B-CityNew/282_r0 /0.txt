<Reasoning>Since the grid points are labeled with their coordinates, it can be seen that moving to the point with coordinates (-26, 26, 0) will bring me closer to the object, which is expected to be located further north and slightly to the west. This move will also allow me to see if the object is indeed at that location, or if I need to adjust my search area.</Reasoning>
