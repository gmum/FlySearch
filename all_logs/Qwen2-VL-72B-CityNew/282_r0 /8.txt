<Reasoning>Since the drone is already at the required altitude and the object of interest is visible in the current frame, it is likely that the drone is centered directly above the object. Therefore, there is no need to move or adjust the drone's position any further. The search can be considered complete, and the drone can maintain its current position until further action is required.</Reasoning>
