<Reasoning>From the current angle of the image, it appears that the drone is not centered directly above the object, but rather slightly to the left. To ensure that the search is thorough and that the drone is in the correct position, a slight adjustment to the right at the current altitude is necessary. This will allow the drone to be centered directly above the object, which will ensure that the search is thorough and that the drone is in the correct position to identify the anomaly.</Reasoning>
