<Reasoning>Since I am currently 82 meters above ground level, which is significantly higher than the required 10 meters, I will first move down to get closer to the ground level. I will then move eastward to check for the white pickup truck. I need to ensure I am not too far off the ground when I find it.</Reasoning>
