<Reasoning>There are two red vehicles in the image, but neither is a sport car. The red vehicle near (-40, -40) is a van. The other red vehicle near (0, 0) is too small to be a sport car. I need to go closer to confirm if any of these vehicles are the one I am looking for. I will fly lower and to the south to get a better view.</Reasoning>
