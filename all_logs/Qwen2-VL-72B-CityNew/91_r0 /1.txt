<Reasoning>At the current altitude of 30 meters, I am getting a closer view of the ground level, but I do not see the large trash pile yet. I should fly over the rooftop to the right at a lower altitude to inspect the area more closely. This will help me identify the trash pile if it is present in this vicinity.</Reasoning>
