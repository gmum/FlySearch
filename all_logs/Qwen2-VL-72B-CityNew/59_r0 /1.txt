<Reasoning>Although I do not see the black pickup truck in this view, I notice that I am still relatively high above ground level. To improve my chances of spotting the truck, I need to move closer to the ground while maintaining a reasonable field of view. I will move south and east, aiming to get closer to the object while covering more area in my search.</Reasoning>
