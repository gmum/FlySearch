<Reasoning>Given the current altitude of 80 meters, the initial step should involve descending to get closer to the ground to have a better chance of spotting the trash pile. I'll lower my altitude significantly, but not too much to avoid missing the object if it's not immediately visible. I'll also shift slightly to the left to explore a different area that could potentially contain the trash pile. Adjusting to (-53, 27) will give me a good vantage point to search for the object.
