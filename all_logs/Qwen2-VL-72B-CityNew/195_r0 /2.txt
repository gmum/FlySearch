<Reasoning>Having moved to the right and upwards, I am now at 30 meters above ground level. The trash pile is not visible from this angle. To continue the search, I will move back to the left and descend slightly to get a closer look at the area previously covered from a higher altitude, which might reveal the trash pile if it's hidden or obscured.
