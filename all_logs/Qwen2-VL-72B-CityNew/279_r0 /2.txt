<Reasoning>The anomaly is now within my field of view and appears to be a large metallic object on the road. I am currently positioned at an altitude of 9 meters, which is below the 10 meters requirement. Since I am centered on the object and it is clear that it does not fit into the environment, I can now confirm that this is the anomaly I was tasked to find.</Reasoning>
