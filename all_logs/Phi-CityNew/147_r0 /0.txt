    I am starting at the top of the grid (0,0) and there is a crowd visible below. I should move closer to the ground to find the crowd. I will move to the bottom of the grid (-22,0) and see if the crowd is located there.

    The crowd is not at the bottom of the grid, it is on the road with the vehicles. I will move down and to the right to find the crowd.

    I am moving closer to the ground but still not at the correct location. I will continue moving down and to the right.
