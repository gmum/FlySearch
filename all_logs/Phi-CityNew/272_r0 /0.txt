<Reasoning>This orange marker seems to be the object I'm looking for. It's at ground level and stands out against the others. I've chosen to move down 10 meters to see if I can get a closer look.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I think I have found the object! It's the orange marker at ground level. To confirm, I will lower myself to 5 meters below it.</Reasoning>
