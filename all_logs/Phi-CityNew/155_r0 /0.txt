    <Reasoning>After making the first move, I need to continue searching for the object. The object might be towards the upper left part of the grid, so I should move towards that direction while keeping the altitude low.</Reasoning>

    <Reasoning>I should continue my search in the upper left area of the grid. Now, I am closer to the object and still below the altitude of 10 meters. If the object is indeed the yellow point, I will reply with "FOUND".</Reasoning>

    <Reasoning>The object might be slightly to the right of the yellow point. I should move slightly left and keep my altitude low to increase my chances of seeing it.</Reasoning>
