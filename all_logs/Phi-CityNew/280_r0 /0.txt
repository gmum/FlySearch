 <Reasoning>The object in question appears to be a yellow point within the image's center, possibly a traffic light or a sign. I will move closer to it to verify that it is the object of interest. Given the constraints, I cannot move too far down or too far left, as it might lead to the drone flying out of the field of view. I'll also need to ensure that I do not exceed the altitude limit of 120 meters.</Reasoning>
