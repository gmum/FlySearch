 <Reasoning>I have found the object of interest at a significant distance; it is a yellow point mapped to (-14, 38) on the grid. Since it's far away, I cannot comply with the instruction to fly below 10 meters. Yet, I must maintain vigilance and continue to scan for any additional anomalies.</Reasoning>
