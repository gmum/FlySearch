 To move the drone closer to the intersection, I will fly to the coordinates (-1, 0, -1) which is 1 meter below the current position.

<Reasoning>The intersection is a good candidate for the road construction site, and moving closer will confirm if it's indeed the target of the construction. I will also need to be careful in case there are construction workers or moving vehicles.</Reasoning>
