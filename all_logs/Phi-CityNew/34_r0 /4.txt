 To move the drone closer to the intersection, I will fly to the coordinates (-1, 0, -1) which is 1 meter below the current position.

<Reasoning>The intersection appears to be a good candidate for the road construction site. Moving closer will allow me to confirm if it's indeed the target of the construction and ensure that the current altitude is safe for landing or hovering.</Reasoning>
