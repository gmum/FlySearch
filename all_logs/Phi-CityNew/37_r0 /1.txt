 <Reasoning>In the second image, there is a collection of coordinates that seem to be positioned around a central point. Given that my primary objective is to locate a road construction site, it is important to analyze the coordinates for any that may indicate the presence of a construction site. The coordinates (24, -19) are at the edge of the image, close to the bottom center. If this is indeed the construction site, it might be on the ground level from the perspective of the drone. A move that brings the drone closer to this point could be our best option to find the construction site. The coordinates for this maneuver are (0, 0, -27), which will bring the drone 0 meters to the right and 27 meters down. This position ensures we're close to the ground and indeed might be the area in question.</Reasoning>
