 <Reasoning>The third image presents coordinates that are distributed across a central vertical line, with many points near the edge of the image. It is essential to pinpoint where the road construction site could be. The coordinates (10, -10) and (20, -10) seem to be at the left edge of this vertical line, suggesting they could be close to the ground level, ideal for us to investigate for a road construction site. Given the drone's altitude is now at 30 meters, a move that brings the drone closer to this area would be beneficial. The move will be calculated to bring the drone 10 meters left and 20 meters down from the current position, bringing it in line with the coordinates (10, -10) and (20, -10).</Reasoning>
