 <Reasoning>Looking at the first image, it seems that there are no clear road construction sites visible. However, the coordinates indicate that there is a potential object of interest to the left of the drone's current position, marked with the coordinates (24, -24). Given the elevated perspective, if this is indeed a road or construction site, it is likely to be below the drone's current altitude. Therefore, it would be prudent to move the drone closer to this potential object to confirm if it is the target we are looking for. The coordinates for this move would be (10, 0, -14), which takes the drone 10 meters to the left and 14 meters down, closer to the ground.</Reasoning>
