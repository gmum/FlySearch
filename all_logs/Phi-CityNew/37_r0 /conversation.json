        "\n<Context>\n    You are in command of a UAV, tasked with finding a road construction site.\n</Context>\n\n<Objective>\n    You should fly BELOW 10 meters above the object and then reply with \"FOUND\". Being lower (closer to the object) (like 9, 8, or less meters) is good, being higher than that (like 11, 12, or more meters) is bad. \n\n    You may not be able to see the object in the first image, so you need to perform a careful search. Your performance will be evaluated based on whether the object was at most 10 meters below the drone when you replied with \"FOUND\". The object MUST be in your field of view when you reply with \"FOUND\". You must be centered on the object. \n</Objective>\n\n<Coordinates>\n    There is a grid overlaid on each image you are presented with. It is meant to (roughly) communicate which point will be in drone's center of vision if you move in that direction. Note that height of the drone is not represented in the grid.\n</Coordinates>\n\n<Controls>\n    <Action space>\n        To move the drone in a certain direction, use the following format: <Action>(x, y, z)</Action>. For example, if you want to fly to the place denoted as (10, 10) on the grid without changing the altitude, you should reply with <Action>(10, 10, 0)</Action>.\n\n        x and y are the coordinates on the grid, and z is the altitude difference. For example, <Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action> means that you are moving 10 meters down. This is especially important, since you need to get close to the object in question.\n\n    </Action space>\n\n    <Formatting>\n\n        Your each response should contain XML <Reasoning> tag and <Action> tag.\n        <Reasoning> tag should contain your reasoning for the move you are making.\n        <Action> tag should contain the move you are making.\n\n        If you find the object, fly below 10 meters relative to it and reply with \"FOUND\". Remember, it must be in your field of view when you reply with \"FOUND\" and you must be 10 meters above it or closer. Being too far away is not acceptable.\n\n        For example:\n\n        <Reasoning>This yellow point might be the object in question. I need to go lower to check for that. If it's not the object in question, I will continue the search. I will also slightly go to the north.</Reasoning>\n        <Action>(5, 0, -30)</Action>\n\n    </Formatting>\n\n    <Limitations>\n        You shouldn't move into coordinates that are outside of your view. Otherwise, you may hit something which is not ideal.\n        You can make at most 9 moves. Your altitude cannot exceed 120 meters. Your search area is 400x400m from the drone's starting position. \n    </Limitations>\n</Controls>\n"

        " <Reasoning>Looking at the first image, it seems that there are no clear road construction sites visible. However, the coordinates indicate that there is a potential object of interest to the left of the drone's current position, marked with the coordinates (24, -24). Given the elevated perspective, if this is indeed a road or construction site, it is likely to be below the drone's current altitude. Therefore, it would be prudent to move the drone closer to this potential object to confirm if it is the target we are looking for. The coordinates for this move would be (10, 0, -14), which takes the drone 10 meters to the left and 14 meters down, closer to the ground.</Reasoning>\n    <Action>(10, 0, -14)</Action>"

        " <Reasoning>In the second image, there is a collection of coordinates that seem to be positioned around a central point. Given that my primary objective is to locate a road construction site, it is important to analyze the coordinates for any that may indicate the presence of a construction site. The coordinates (24, -19) are at the edge of the image, close to the bottom center. If this is indeed the construction site, it might be on the ground level from the perspective of the drone. A move that brings the drone closer to this point could be our best option to find the construction site. The coordinates for this maneuver are (0, 0, -27), which will bring the drone 0 meters to the right and 27 meters down. This position ensures we're close to the ground and indeed might be the area in question.</Reasoning>\n    <Action>(0, 0, -27)</Action>"

        " <Reasoning>The third image presents coordinates that are distributed across a central vertical line, with many points near the edge of the image. It is essential to pinpoint where the road construction site could be. The coordinates (10, -10) and (20, -10) seem to be at the left edge of this vertical line, suggesting they could be close to the ground level, ideal for us to investigate for a road construction site. Given the drone's altitude is now at 30 meters, a move that brings the drone closer to this area would be beneficial. The move will be calculated to bring the drone 10 meters left and 20 meters down from the current position, bringing it in line with the coordinates (10, -10) and (20, -10).</Reasoning>\n    <Action>(-10, 20)</Action>"
