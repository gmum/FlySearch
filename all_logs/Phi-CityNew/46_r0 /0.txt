 <Reasoning>As I am standing at an altitude of 61 meters above the ground, I will move 11 meters closer to the ground to get lower and have a better chance of finding the large trash pile, which is mentioned in the context. This will bring my altitude down to 50 meters and also improve my field of view.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>After the first move, I will now move further south to ensure that I am closer to the object's estimated location on the grid. This should maximize the chances of finding the object if it is in the downward direction.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Now that I am much closer to the ground, I will move a bit northeast to increase my chances of locating the large trash pile, which should be on the grid within my current field of view.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>If the object is not visible, I will move to the left to broaden my field of view. Being able to see less than 10 meters below means that I am likely to spot the object if it is located within that range.</Re
