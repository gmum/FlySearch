 <Reasoning>My current altitude of 15 meters is still not ideal for spotting the large trash pile. To maximize my chances of finding it, I need to lower my altitude by 1 meter to be as close to the ground as possible, which will give me the largest possible field of view.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Once I've descended, I will adjust my position slightly to the left to ensure that I am scanning a wider area that could potentially contain the trash pile, as indicated by the grid positions.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I need to make one more step to the left to cover more ground and increase the probability of spotting the trash pile. If it's not found within the next move, I will continue to do so until it is within my view.</Reasoning>
