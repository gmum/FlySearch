 Given the altitude of 66 meters, I am not currently able to perform the search as I need to be closer to the object on the ground to ensure I can find it if it is indeed fire-related and visible from an aerial position. I would need to decrease in height, likely by a significant margin, to gain a closer view, which will be my next move.
