 <Reasoning>I am starting my search from 74 meters above ground level. I need to move lower to find the object. I will start with a move that takes me closer to the bottom of the image and see if the object is visible.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am looking for an object that doesn't fit in with the environment. After this move, I will look for it on the ground. If I don't see it, I will make another move. I will continue this process until I find the object.</Reasoning>
