 <Reasoning>With the current altitude at 47 meters, I can fly down to at least 37 meters to be within the 10-meter altitude range. The closest coordinates to this target altitude are (0, 0, -10). This move should allow me to get even closer and enhance the chances of finding the road construction site.</Reasoning>
