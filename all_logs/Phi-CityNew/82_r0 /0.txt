 <Reasoning>It looks like the object might be in the lower part of the image. I need to navigate to it with caution, ensuring that I don't fly too high to miss it or too low to risk a collision. The coordinates I can see seem to be in a vertical section of the image, which suggests that the object might be on the ground or close to it.</Reasoning>
