 <Reasoning>The object I am looking for is a white pickup truck. I need to search the area carefully. Since the truck might be hidden among the buildings or behind them, I should start by looking below the ground level where the truck might be. The coordinates (0, 0) on the grid show a point at ground level, so I will fly there.</Reasoning>
