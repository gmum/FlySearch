 <Reasoning>I will start by flying slowly to get a better view of the environment. I need to focus on areas with high contrast and anomalies. I will try to identify the object based on its location, shape, and color.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>After reviewing the image, I have identified a likely candidate for the anomaly. It appears to be a structure with a distinct shape and pattern that differs from the surrounding environment.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I have found a few more candidate structures that could potentially be the anomaly.</Reasoning>
