I've moved closer to the ground, and I can see the building in front of me. I need to move towards the area with yellow markings, as it is likely the police car is located there.

I am now above the yellow markings, but I am still not close enough to the ground. I need to fly lower to get a closer view.

I can see the yellow markings on the ground, but I need to be closer to make sure it's the police car. I will move slightly to the right to get a better view.

I see the yellow markings more clearly now, but it's not the police car. I will move a little further to the right.
