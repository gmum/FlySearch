The first image shows a series of points with coordinates overlaid on a parking area, which indicates a curved structure possibly under construction or an existing one. My objective is to find a road construction site, which is not clearly identified in the first image.

I'm going to fly down 10 meters relative to the starting point without changing the altitude to get a closer view of the structure and scan for any signs of construction.

Since the structure's outline is not clearly visible, I will fly a bit further down, 20 meters lower, to get a better view of the structure's dimensions.

I'm going to make two more moves to get as close as possible to the structure from different angles to better assess if it's a road construction site. Both moves are 10 meters down to improve the view.
