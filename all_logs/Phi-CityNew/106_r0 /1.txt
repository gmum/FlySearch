Since the coordinates are not clear, I am starting with the assumption that there is a road construction site at the coordinates (13, 13) as given. I need to verify if this is the correct location by moving down to be closer to it.

I am now closer to the ground. By moving further down, I can get an even closer look at the surroundings, searching for any construction-related indicators.
