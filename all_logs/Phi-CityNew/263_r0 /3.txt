 <Reasoning>Starting my search from the yellow marker, I'll look for any differences in the environment that could indicate the presence of an anomaly. The marker stands out, so it's a good place to begin.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>After examining the area around the marker, I do not find any significant differences that suggest an anomaly. Hence, I'll continue my search to the next point of interest, which is (6, 13) on the grid.</Reasoning>
<Action>(6, 13, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>The coordinates (6, 13) reveal a point with a distinct structure that is not in line with the urban pattern. This could be the object I'm looking for, as it appears to be isolated.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>As I investigate the area around (6, 13), I notice a structure that is different from the surrounding buildings. This isolated construction might be the anomaly I've been searching for.</Reasoning>
