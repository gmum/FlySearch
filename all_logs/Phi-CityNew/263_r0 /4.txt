 <Reasoning>Considering the yellow marker, I will start my search at this point, as it appears to be significant in the urban environment.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>After scanning the immediate area around the marker, it seems to blend in with the surrounding environment. I will move on to the next point of interest, (3, 0), which is slightly further away but could provide a wider view of the area.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The coordinates (3, 0) reveal a vast expanse of open space with few buildings, which could be a good place to find an anomaly that is not in line with the urban pattern.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>As I explore the space around (3, 0), I notice something unusual. There is a structure that is not built into the ground, unlike the surrounding buildings. This could be the object I'm searching for.</Reasoning>
