<Action>(0, 0, -20)</Action>

<Reasoning>Upon reaching the starting point, I will scan the immediate area for any anomalies. However, after a thorough scan, I do not spot anything that fits the criteria of being an out-of-place object in the urban environment.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Since there seems to be no immediate anomaly, I'll proceed to the next point of interest, which is indicated by the coordinates (20, 20) on the grid. This area might provide a different perspective of the surroundings which could reveal something unique.</Reasoning>
<Action>(20, 20, -30)</Action>

<Reasoning>The area around the coordinates (20, 20) reveals a structure that is different from the rest of the environment. It's isolated and elevated, possibly a building or platform. This may be the object I'm searching for.</Reasoning>
