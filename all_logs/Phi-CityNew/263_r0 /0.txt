 <Reasoning>Since I'm looking for an object that doesn't fit in with the rest of the environment, I will start my search by going to the point where the yellow marker is placed. This point seems to be out of the usual pattern of the environment and could very well be the object I'm looking for.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>After reaching the yellow point, I will look around for the object, checking the surrounding areas in the grid for any significant difference in the environment. It's crucial to ensure that the object is close to my position to confirm if it's the anomaly I'm looking for.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Upon examining the area, I don't seem to find any object that matches the criteria of being an anomaly. Therefore, I will continue my search by moving to the next point of interest.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>Continuing my search, I observe a point on the grid that looks quite distinct from the others, with a large empty space nearby. This could be a good candidate for the anomaly. I will move towards it to investigate further.</Re
