<Reasoning>
The drone has descended to the correct altitude of 89 meters above ground level, which allows it to be 10 meters below the object in question (at 80 meters) when replying with "FOUND". The object in question seems to be at (0, 0, 0) meters, so the drone should move 10 meters down to be in the center of its view.
