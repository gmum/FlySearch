<Action>(0, 0, -20)</Action>

<Reasoning>To get closer to the yellow square, I'll make a move lower, which will also bring me in line with it.</Reasoning>

<Action>(0, 0, -20)</Action>

<Action>(0, 0, -20)</Action>

<Reasoning>Upon inspecting the area, I can confirm that the yellow square is indeed the object of interest because it is distinctly different from the surrounding markers.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am now 20 meters below the object, which is within the required range for my mission.</Reasoning>
