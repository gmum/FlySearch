 <Reasoning>I will start by moving to coordinates (5, 0, -10) to cover the largest area possible. I will then move to coordinates (0, 0, -5) for a wider view and to ensure I am at the correct altitude. If the object is not found, I will continue to lower the altitude to -2 meters to get closer. I will give a "FOUND" response if within the 10-meter range below the object. <Action>(5, 0, -10)</Action></Reasoning>
