 <Reasoning>I will start by flying to the coordinates (5, 0, -10) to cover the largest area possible. I will then make a slight turn to the left to scan the area vertically and look for the object. If not found, I will continue to lower the altitude to -5 meters to ensure a closer view, as these coordinates seem promising. <Action>(5, 0, -10)</Action></Reasoning>
