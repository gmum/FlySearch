I am starting my search at a height of 100 meters above the ground level, which is within my operational limits. I will need to lower my altitude to find the object. I'll begin by moving down 15 meters.

I've moved down 15 meters, which should allow me to be closer to the possible ground level of the object if it is indeed below this altitude. Next, I need to make a decision based on what I can see from this altitude.

The image from this altitude is clearer, and I can see a yellow point, which might be the object I'm looking for. To be closer to it, I need to lower my altitude further. I'll make another move down 5 meters and adjust my horizontal position to center the drone over the point.

Same as before, I need to ensure the object is within my field of view and that I'm 10 meters
