I am starting my search at a height of 30 meters above the ground level, which is within my operational limits. I will need to lower my altitude to find the object. I'll begin by moving down 10 meters.

I now have moved down 10 meters, which should allow me to be closer to the possible ground level of the object if it is indeed below this altitude. Next, I need to make a decision based on what I can see from this altitude.

The image from this altitude is clearer, and I can see a yellow point, which might be the object I'm looking for. To be closer to it, I need to lower my altitude further. I'll make a move down 2 meters and adjust my horizontal position to center the drone over the point.

Same as before, I need to ensure the object is within my field of view and that I'm 10 meters or closer in altitude
