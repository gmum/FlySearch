 <Reasoning>I am at an altitude of 49 meters above ground level, and there is a risk of hitting the structure. I need to adjust my altitude safely.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -30)</Action>

<Reasoning>I have found a safe spot to reposition my drone to avoid the structure. I will move to the coordinates (0, 0) and increase my altitude to 30 meters.</Reasoning>
