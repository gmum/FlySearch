 <Reasoning>I'm still too high to make a final decision on the object. I must move closer to conduct a proper assessment. Since the object seems to be located in the middle of the grid, I will move towards the center (0, 0) to minimize the altitude and maximize the field of view. This should give me the best chance to identify the anomaly.</Reasoning>
