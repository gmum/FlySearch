 <Reasoning>I need to lower the drone to get a closer look at the object. It's currently too high to determine if it's the anomaly. By moving in a way that I'm closer to the object, I'll be able to assess whether it fits the criteria of an anomaly or not. Additionally, I should move to the side to cover more ground. I will be careful to stay within the view limits as I continue the search.</Reasoning>
