 <Reasoning>Given that I am at an altitude of 13 meters above ground level, I am already close to the ground. The grid shows a mix of urban and possibly rural areas, with buildings, roads, and open spaces. I need to scan the grid for any signs of construction, such as machinery, materials, or other indicators. The central grid, particularly the bottom middle area, seems to have a higher concentration of buildings, which could be a good place to start. If I find any indications of construction, I will reply with "FOUND" and provide the coordinates of my position.</Reasoning>
