 <Reasoning>With an altitude of 23 meters, I have a good view of the urban environment and some rural areas. The grid shows various points of interest, including buildings, roads, and possibly construction sites. I will focus my search on areas with construction indicators, such as machinery or materials. By moving in the direction of the central grid point (0, 15), I can cover a larger area and increase my chances of finding the construction site. If I find any signs of construction or anything that might indicate a construction site, I will reply with "FOUND" and provide the coordinates of my position.</Reasoning>
