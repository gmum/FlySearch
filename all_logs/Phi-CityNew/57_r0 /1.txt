 <Reasoning>My objective is to find a road construction site at an altitude of 43 meters above ground level. Since the coordinates in the grid represent an urban area, I need to navigate through the buildings and streets to find the road construction site. The central grid area seems to be the most likely location for the construction site, as it is a typical place for such activities. I will start by moving in the direction of the central point of the grid, which appears to be (14, 14), and then proceed to the bottom of the image to check for the construction site. If I find the construction site or any part of it, I will reply with "FOUND" and provide the coordinates of my current position.</Reasoning>
