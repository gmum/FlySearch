<Reasoning>I need to confirm if the object is located within my field of view. If not, I must adjust my y-coordinate further until it is visible. This is important as it helps me ensure that the next move will be in a position where the object can be found if it exists.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am now at a lower altitude which allows me to check for the presence of the police car in the visible area below the drone. I will continue to ensure that my altitude is within the specified limit of 120 meters.</Reasoning>
