    Before proceeding with my search for the anomaly, I need to go down to a level where I can get a closer look at the objects below.

    Since I am only 48 meters above ground level, I should focus my search around the center of the grid to maximize my chances of spotting anything unusual.

    I will fly to the coordinates (0, 0, 0) and stay directly below these points, which will help me in covering a larger area and increasing the probability of finding the object.

    By flying here, I am ensuring that my altitude is at the lowest point possible without exceeding the altitude restriction.

    Now, I'm at the lowest altitude I can be to start my search. I will hover around the center of the grid and scan for any objects that stand out as being different from the rest.
