 <Reasoning>I'm looking for a point that stands out among this grid. It should be a building that doesn't match the repetitive pattern of the surrounding structures.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -5)</Action>

<Reasoning>This point seems to be slightly off the main grid, but it's important for proper navigation. I should maintain a heading that aligns with the grid for better assessment.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 5, -5)</Action>

<Reasoning>It's clear that this point isn't the anomaly we're after; it's in line with the other buildings and has a consistent modern pattern.</Reasoning>
<Action>(5, 5, -5)</Action>

<Reasoning>I've adjusted my altitude to gain a clear view. Now, I'm scanning this area to see if there's an anomaly we've missed.</Reasoning>
<Action>(5, 0, -5)</Action>

<Reasoning>After reviewing the area, it seems like we're not finding the object. I'll continue scanning the next section, but if it's not there, I'll reassess and try a different approach.</Reasoning>
