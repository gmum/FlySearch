 <Reasoning>Since I cannot see the object in the provided image, I will use the grid to navigate and try to locate the object. I will focus on the yellow points as they might be where the object is. I will make sure not to go beyond the 400x400m boundary and maintain my altitude below 120 meters to avoid hitting anything unseen.</Reasoning>
