        The object in question is likely to be a yellow point on the ground, which is mentioned in the context. To reach the object, I will decrease my altitude while staying within the designated search area and ensuring I do not go beyond the 10 meters height limit. Since the coordinates are given, I will adjust my altitude accordingly without moving far from the yellow point.
