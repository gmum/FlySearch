        The coordinates suggest the object is near the (0, -21) point on the ground, which is at the lower left section of the image. Since I am currently at 63 meters above ground level, I can safely decrease my altitude to 2 meters above ground level, while ensuring the object is within my field of view when I reply with "FOUND".
