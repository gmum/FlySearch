 <Reasoning>I'm too close to the ground at (0, 0), so I need to reset to a safer altitude. Rising to a moderate altitude will also give me a better vantage point for scanning the area for the construction site.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I'll start my search from the grid coordinates (1, 0). It's within my view, and it allows for a good balance of safety and visibility for the next move.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>It's not the site, so I'll move to (0, 1) to get a different perspective. Safety gains priority, so I'll maintain a moderate altitude to avoid any immediate threats.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I'll continue the search around this safe position. The point at (0, 2) might be worth checking due to its proximity and visibility. I'll reassess my altitude for the next move to ensure safety.</Reasoning>
