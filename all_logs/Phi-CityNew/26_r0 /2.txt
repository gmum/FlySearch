<Reasoning>I need to find a safer altitude and then reassess my current position to find the construction site. After ascending, I should employ a cautious search pattern, moving in a grid step pattern while maintaining a safe altitude above potential obstructions.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>A nearby point of interest is at (3, -4), so I will fly there to have a closer view of the ground level. This allows for a more accurate assessment of whether I am over an active construction site.</Reasoning>
