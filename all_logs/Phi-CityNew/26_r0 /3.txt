 <Reasoning>The grid coordinates (0, 0) are within my field of view, so I'll move there to continue the search for the road construction site. I must be cautious of my surrounding to avoid potential collisions.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The point at (0, 0) seems to be the site, but I'll move closer to confirm it by descending to a lower altitude. I should do so carefully to ensure I'm safe and not at risk of colliding with nearby structures.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The structure at (0, 0) is indeed a road construction site. I will move to the grid coordinates (1, 1) for a clearer assessment of the site from this height.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I should now ascend to avoid further risk of collision and to prepare for a systematic search from this new position. I will move in a pattern that covers the area systematically while maintaining a safe altitude.</Reasoning>
