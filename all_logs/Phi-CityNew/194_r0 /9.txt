 <Reasoning>I am too low and would have hit something. I need to move to a safe altitude.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, 10)</Action>

<Reasoning>I am now at a safe altitude, I will proceed to find the object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, 40)</Action>

<Reasoning>The object seems to be located at grid (27, 27), which is on the ground level. I need to be closer to it, so I will move to (27, 27, -20) to be 20 meters below the object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(27, 27, -20)</Action>

<Reasoning>The object is still not in my field of view, I will move to (27, 27, -50) to get a better view of it.</Reasoning>
<Action>(27, 27, -50)</Action>

<Reasoning>I can now see the object and it is located at grid (27, 27), at ground level, so I will stay at (27, 27).</Reasoning>
