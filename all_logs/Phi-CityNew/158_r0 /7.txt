 <Reasoning>The object of interest isn't visible, and my altitude is 21 meters above ground level. I need to further decrease my altitude to find the large trash pile. The coordinates (0, 0, -10) will allow me to be 10 meters below my current altitude and remain within the area where the object might be located.</Reasoning>
