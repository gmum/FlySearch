 <Reasoning>Since I am currently at 49 meters above ground level and the object is not directly visible, I will move down to get closer to it. The grid points provided suggest that I can move to (0, 0, -10) to be only 10 meters below my current position and still be in the field of view of the drone. This is a safe move closer to the potential location of the large trash pile.</Reasoning>
