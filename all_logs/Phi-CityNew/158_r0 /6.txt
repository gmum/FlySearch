 <Reasoning>I have been given an alert that there is a potential hazard within 1-meter range. Immediate action is required to ensure safety. I will ascend to a height that is out of immediate danger while still allowing for some visibility to the area around the object of interest. The coordinates (0, 0, 10) will provide a safe distance from the hazard and some visibility to the trash pile.</Reasoning>
