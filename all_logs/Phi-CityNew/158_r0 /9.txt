 <Reasoning>I am at a safe altitude now, and the large trash pile is still not in sight. I will continue to move horizontally to cover more ground and increase the chances of spotting the trash pile. The coordinates (0, 14, -4) will get me closer to the area where the trash pile might be located, considering the building layout.</Reasoning>
