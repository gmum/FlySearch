 <Reasoning>

    The object may be below 10 meters from the UAV, looking from the top of the frame. Since I am 25 meters above, I need to lower to around 15 meters to have a better chance of spotting the object. Therefore, I will lower the altitude slightly without moving horizontally to maintain a clear line of sight.
