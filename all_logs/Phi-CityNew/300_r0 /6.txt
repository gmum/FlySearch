Since the altitude is now 32 meters above the ground level, I am flying at a lower altitude than the previous tasks. It is important to maintain the altitude at or below 10 meters relative to the object.

The closest point to the object that allows for a closer inspection is (11, 0). I will move there to ensure the object is within my field of view.

I apologize for not finding the object in the given area. There might be several reasons for this, and I will reassess the coordinates and altitude to increase the chances of finding the object.
