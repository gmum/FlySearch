To maximize the chances of finding the object, I must fly at a lower altitude. Since the object must be at most 10 meters below the drone, I need to move lower in altitude while ensuring the object is within my field of view when I report finding it.

The coordinates (0, 0) are within the field of view, and it's the closest point that allows me to be lower than the object without being outside the field of view.
