I will start by moving to the coordinates on the grid that are closest to the object of interest. Since the object must be at most 10 meters below the drone when found, I need to plan my moves accordingly.

I am currently at the specified altitude, but I will fly lower to reach the object. The closest point on the grid that appears most promising is (0, 0). I will aim to fly there first.

After moving to coordinate (0, 0) I will perform a thorough search to avoid missing the object.
