Since the altitude is 57 meters above ground level and the object must be at most 10 meters below the drone when found, I need to move to a lower altitude to increase the chances of finding the object.

The closest point on the grid that is below the current altitude is (0, 0). Moving there will ensure I can search the area most likely to contain the object.
