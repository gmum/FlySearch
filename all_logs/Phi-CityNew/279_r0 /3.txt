 Given the current altitude is 20 meters above ground level, I will move as follows:

<Reasoning>
I am going to lower the altitude to get closer to the ground to ensure the object is in my field of view when I state "FOUND".
</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

This is my first move, lowering the altitude.

<Reasoning>
Now I will move downward to the coordinates where I think the object might be located.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(-10, 0, -10)</Action>

I suspect the object might be near the coordinates (-10, 0).

Next, I will slightly move to the right to explore the area around the expected location of the object.
