 Given the current altitude is 60 meters above ground level, I will move as follows:

<Reasoning>
I am going to lower the altitude to get closer to the ground to ensure the object is in my field of view when I state "FOUND".
</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -30)</Action>

This is my first move, lowering the altitude.

<Reasoning>
Now I will move downward to the coordinates where I think the object might be located.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, -10, -30)</Action>

I suspect the object might be near the coordinates (0, -10).

<Reasoning>
Next, I will slightly move to the right to explore the area around the expected location of the object.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(10, -10, -30)</Action>

<Reasoning>
I am staying low and moving right, hoping the object might be around these coordinates.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(10, -10, -30)</Action>

<Reasoning>
I am still in the vicinity of the coordinates where I thought the object might be located.
