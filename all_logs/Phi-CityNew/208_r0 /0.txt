 <Reasoning>I'll start by scanning the area to the southwest as it's been less explored by previous UAVs. This might increase the chance of finding the object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(5, -5, -40)</Action>

<Reasoning>No object is immediately visible in the southwest area. Next, I'll move slightly to the northwest as it's a common area for objects to be found.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, -5, -40)</Action>

<Reasoning>There's a yellow point south of the drone, it's isolated and could be the object. Moving closer will confirm if it's the right one.</Reasoning>
<Action>(1, -4, -35)</Action>

<Reasoning>The yellow point is indeed the object in question! It's not centered in the frame but should be found. I'll move the drone below it to home in on the object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(1, -4, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>The object is within view and below the drone's altitude. I should now be at 10 meters below the object to confirm it's the right one.</Reasoning>
