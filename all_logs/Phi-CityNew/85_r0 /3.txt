 <Reasoning>Under the circumstances, I need to remain in close proximity to the ground to ensure a thorough search for fire. I will continue to stay at an altitude of 1 meter as I move to the next point directly above the grid point (-0.5, 1.5) to maintain a low altitude and high visibility for detecting fire signs.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>After arriving at the new location above (-0.5, 1.5), I will perform a detailed scan of the area below this point, looking for any indications of fire. If the fire is not visible, I will proceed with the next move to continue the search process while ensuring I remain within the 10-meter radius requirement.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The next point to scan is below the grid point (-0.5, 1.5). If no fire signs are detected, I will make a calculated move to the next grid point that I can reach from my current location to maintain the search process and continue the search process from a lower altitude.</Reasoning>
