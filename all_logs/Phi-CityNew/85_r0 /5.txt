 <Reasoning>Since I am already at an adequate altitude for the search, I will move to the next grid point to continue the search process. The next point of interest is approximately (-0.5, 1.5), which is directly above the suspected fire location.</Reasoning>

<Action>(0, 0, -1)</Action>

<Reasoning>After reaching the new location above (-0.5, 1.5), I will perform an inspection of the area below this point, looking for any signs of fire. If the fire is not visible, I will continue the search process.</Reasoning>

<Action>(0, 0, -1)</Action>

<Reasoning>I have arrived at the next point of interest. I will carefully examine the area below it for signs of fire. If there is no fire, I will make another move to the next grid point that I can reach from my current location to maintain the search process while staying within the 10-meter radius requirement.</Reasoning>

<Action>(0.5, 0.5, -1)</Action>

<Reasoning>The search continues above the grid point (-0.5, 1.5). If no fire is detected, I will move to the next grid point that I can reach from my current location
