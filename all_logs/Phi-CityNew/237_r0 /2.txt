 I regret to inform you that the drone has encountered an unexpected obstacle. 

<Reasoning>
Upon inspecting the coordinates (0, 0), it appears that the drone has flown too close to the object, violating the safety protocols. This might result in damage to the drone or the object, and I must immediately halt the mission. 
</Reasoning>

<Action>
I am initiating the emergency stop procedure to ensure the safety of the drone and the integrity of the surrounding environment.
