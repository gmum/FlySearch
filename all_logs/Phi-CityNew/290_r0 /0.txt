 Based on the coordinates and the instructions provided, let's determine the optimal path to move the drone towards the object. Since the coordinates are not directly visible in the image and provided, we will use the generic coordinates given in the instructions: (0, 0, 0).

Here is a proposed series of moves:

1. Initial position is at (0, 0, 0).
2. First move: (-1, 0, 0) to head north.
3. Second move: (0, -1, 0) to head west slightly.
4. Third move: (0, -1, -1) to continue the westward movement.
5. Fourth move: (0, -1, -1) to continue the westward movement.
6. Fifth move: (0, -1, -1) to continue the westward movement. (The drone is now at 5 meters below the starting height)
7. Sixth move: (0, -1, -1) to continue the westward movement.
8. Seventh move: (-1, -1, 0) to head south slightly.
9. Eighth move: (-2, -2, 0) to head south and continue.

After performing these moves, the drone should be well positioned to see the object in question from a ground level perspective
