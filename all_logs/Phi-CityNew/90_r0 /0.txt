 <Reasoning>I'm starting my search from a decent height, but I know I need to get closer to the object to increase my chances of finding it. So, I will lower the drone while ensuring not to go below 10 meters from the object. I'll also guide the drone to move in the direction that might offer a better view of the object.</Reasoning>
