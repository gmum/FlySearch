    To move the drone to the location of the crowd of people, which appears to be around the coordinates (0, 0), the best coordinates would be around (0, 0), which should be 9 meters below the drone's current height of 9 meters.
    Therefore, the action to take would be:
    <Action>(0, 0, 0)</Action>
</Action space>

<Reasoning>
    The crowd of people appears to be the object of interest, and it seems to be centrally located. I need to get closer to it to confirm that it is the object I'm looking for. To do that, I will move to the coordinates (0, 0) with an altitude of 9 meters above the ground, which is 9 meters below the drone's current altitude.
