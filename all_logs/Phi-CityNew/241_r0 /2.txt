 <Reasoning>I will start by looking in the coordinates with negative z values, as they could potentially be at the location of the object due to their lower altitude.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Since the object's shape or size is not visible in this image, I should aim to move towards areas with larger x and y values, seeking out the object out of the dense urban environment.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The coordinates with negative z values are promising areas to search for the object. I will continue to move in that direction to maximize the chance of locating it.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I will now move towards coordinates with larger x and y values to search further from the dense urban area where the object may be located.</Reasoning>
