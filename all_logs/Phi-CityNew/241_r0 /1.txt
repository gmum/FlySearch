 <Reasoning>I will start my search at the center of the image and proceed to areas with negative z values, as these could potentially be at the location of the object due to their lower altitude.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>
<Reasoning>The coordinates with negative z values are promising areas to search for the object. I will continue to move in that direction to maximize the chance of locating it.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-1, 0, -20)</Action>
<Reasoning>I will continue to focus on areas with negative z values to increase the likelihood of finding the object. The next coordinates I will check are (-35, -35) and (-17, -35).</Reasoning>
<Action>(-35, -35, -20)</Action>

<Action>(-17, -35, -20)</Action>
<Reasoning>I should now move towards coordinates with larger x and y values to search further from the dense urban area where the object may be located.</Reasoning>
