 <Reasoning>I will begin by looking in the areas that are closer to the ground, especially around the coordinates with negative z values which indicate a lower altitude. I will make my way towards areas with coordinates such as (-55, 0) or (0, -55) which are potential areas where the object may be located.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>It is important to maintain a lower altitude to improve the chances of spotting the object. I should focus on areas where the altitude difference is significant, as it could reveal the object more clearly.</Reasoning>
