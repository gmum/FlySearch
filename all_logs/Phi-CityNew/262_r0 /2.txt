    This move will further lower my altitude, bringing me closer to the ground and improving visibility.

    I am now at a similar altitude as my previous position, but even closer to the ground, which should increase the odds of finding the object.

    I have maintained the same altitude but stayed within the street level view, which is optimal for spotting the object.
