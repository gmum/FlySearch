 <Reasoning>Starting from the provided coordinates, I will move downward to get closer to the object. Since the y-coordinates of the points on the grid are mostly negative, I will move down to the center of the grid's y axis. The altitude I need to change is calculated by averaging the altitude difference of the provided coordinates. That would be (0+0+-25+0+0)/4 = -5 meters. As such, I will adjust my altitude to be 70 meters above ground level to be at least 5 meters above the potential object. Then I will move to the center point of the viewable area, which appears to be at (0, -10).</Reasoning>
