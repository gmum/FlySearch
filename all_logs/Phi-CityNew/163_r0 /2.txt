 <Reasoning>As I am currently in the center of the view, I need to adjust my location slightly to the right to identify the object of interest, which appears to be in the center grid point. I will move to (0, 0) and then to (0, -20), ensuring I am at least 10 meters below the object when I reply with "FOUND."</Reasoning>
