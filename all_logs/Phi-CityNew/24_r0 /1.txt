    The starting coordinates are again too high, so I will start by flying lower to get a better view of the ground. I also want to move towards the center of the image to have a wider search area.

    The grid shows that there might be a yellow point of interest near the center of the image. I will move towards it to check if it is the large trash pile.

    The yellow point is not the object in question. I will move slightly to the left to continue the search while keeping the altitude low.
