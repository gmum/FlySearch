 <Reasoning>Since the objective is to fly below 10 meters above the object, I will begin by descending to a lower altitude while ensuring that I do not exceed the altitude limit of 120 meters or move outside of my view. The starting coordinates suggest that the drone is on the left side of the image, so I will move slightly to the right to get a wider view of the area.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Moving to the right will allow me to cover a larger area and increase the chances of spotting the object. Since I am descending, I am making good progress towards the objective. Now, I will continue to scan the area for the object of interest.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Further rightward movement will provide an even broader view. This should help in spotting the object more easily, if it is indeed to the right in the image.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Since I am confident that the object is not in the immediate left section, as per the current view, I will now focus on the right section to find the object.
