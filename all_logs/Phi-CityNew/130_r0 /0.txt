 <Reasoning>I am starting my search for the fire from a higher altitude. I will focus on finding the coordinates with higher z-values to indicate the presence of a fire. If I cannot find the fire at first, I will adjust my altitude as needed to get closer. I will move one step at a time while avoiding areas that are not relevant to the search.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am moving closer to one of the coordinates with a lower z value, which indicates a potential fire source. If I cannot locate the fire, I will move to the next coordinate with a lower z value.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am now very close to the potential fire source. I need to move one more step to verify if it is the fire.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I have found a fire source at a lower z value. I need to move down to a lower altitude to check if it is the fire.</Reasoning>
