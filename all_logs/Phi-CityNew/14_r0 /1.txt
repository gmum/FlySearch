 <Reasoning>I will move towards one of the suspect points, around (0, -2) because it seems to be the closest to the object. As I proceed, I will keep an eye on the object and adjust my position to get closer if it's closer than -2 meters below the drone. If not, I will continue to scan the area for a better position.</Reasoning>
