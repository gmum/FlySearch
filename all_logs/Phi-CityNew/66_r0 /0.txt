 <Reasoning>I need to get closer to the object to determine if it is the one we are looking for. Since I am currently 57 meters above ground level, I will move down by 38 meters to increase my chances of being in the correct field of view. If the object is not there, I will continue the search with more precise movements.</Reasoning>
