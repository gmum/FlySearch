        I realize I have been too close to an object. The coordinates I am at are within a high-risk area, where I could have caused damage to the drone or the environment.

        I am now safely above the object I was too close to. The area I need to focus on next is the central part of the image, where the most detail is present, to efficiently narrow down the search area.

        After searching the central area I am focusing on, I am still unable to locate the anomaly. My next move will be to the bottom right of the image, which is less cluttered, to see if the object appears there.

        The object I am looking for is not in the bottom right of the image. Therefore, I will move further right to get a different perspective and cover more ground.
