        I am now at a lower altitude, allowing me to search in a different area of the environment. The area on the right side of the image seems to have fewer details, which might help me concentrate on finding the anomaly.

        The object I am looking for is not in the bottom right of the image. Therefore, I will move to the left to cover a different area.

        The object I am looking for is not in the middle of the image. Therefore, I will move to the left to get a different perspective and cover more ground.
