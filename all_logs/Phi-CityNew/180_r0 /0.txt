    The grid overlaid on the image shows several points of interest, but no clear indication of a road construction site is immediately visible. To find the construction site, I should move closer to the ground and examine areas with possible road markings or construction activity.

    Considering the coordinates and the need to fly below 10 meters, I will first move to the point (0,0) which is at the maximum distance from the potential site. This is a good starting point to get an overview of the area.

    Now that I am at the origin point (0,0,0), I need to identify potential sites with road markings or construction signs. Looking at the horizon, there seems to be a dark area that could indicate an underpass or road construction.

    To proceed to the underpass, I will move slightly to the southeast, which is likely the direction I will travel based on the layout of the city grid.
