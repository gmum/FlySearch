    The current altitude being 31 meters above ground level means I am in a safe and stable position above the area of interest. Since I am looking for a road construction site, I should focus on areas that could potentially have the activity on the ground.

    Given the grid and the potential site I'm looking for, the coordinates (21, 0) might be where the road construction site is, or at least where the activity is concentrated.

    <Action>(21,0,0)</Action>
