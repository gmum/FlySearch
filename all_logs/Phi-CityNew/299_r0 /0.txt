 Based on the provided context and requirements, I am tasked with searching for an anomaly that does not fit in with the environment. The objective is to find the object, which is most likely to be standing out due to its different color or size, and to position myself below 10 meters from it.


Considering the grid with coordinates provided, I will strategize my movements to navigate more effectively while keeping an eye out for the anomaly. By analyzing the grid, I can determine if the object is in my field of vision and identify any possible locations for the anomaly.


After examining the image and the coordinates on the grid, I have decided to move to the coordinates (5, 0, -30) to begin my search. This position sets me below the majority of the surrounding environment and within a satisfactory range to identify the object of interest.
