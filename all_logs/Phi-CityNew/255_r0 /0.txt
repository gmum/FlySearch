    <Reasoning>I am starting my search below the object at (0, 0) which seems to be the point in proximity to the ground level. Since I'm supposed to find something that doesn't fit, I assume that the object might be hiding somewhere close to the ground, so I'll start my search in that area.</Reasoning>
