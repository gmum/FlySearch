 <Reasoning>Since the drone is already at ground level, I need to move forward to get closer to the potential fire. The red point on the grid seems to be the object in question, so I will fly forward and slightly to the left to get closer. If the red point is not the fire, I will continue the search in the same direction but at a lower altitude.</Reasoning>
