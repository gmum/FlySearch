 <Reasoning>I need to fly lower to get closer to the potential fire. The yellow point on the grid seems to be the object in question, so I will move down to the ground and then fly slightly to the right to get closer. If the yellow point is not the fire, I will continue the search in the same direction but at a lower altitude.</Reasoning>
