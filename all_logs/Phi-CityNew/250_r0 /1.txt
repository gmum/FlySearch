    The yellow structure is now within my view and I can confirm that it is the object that doesn't fit in with the rest of the environment. I'm going to move closer to verify that I'm right.

        I have confirmed that the yellow structure is indeed the object. I'll now fly down to be 10 meters below it to make the discovery official.

        I have successfully found the object and made the necessary adjustments to my altitude. I am now ready to assess the situation further.
