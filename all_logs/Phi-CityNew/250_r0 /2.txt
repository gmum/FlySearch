    I am now in a position where the yellow structure is clearly visible, and it is not the object that does not fit the environment. There's something else that stands out.

        I have identified a red structure that is different from the surrounding environment, indicating it's the object I am looking for. I'll need to get lower to confirm.

        I am now close to the object and can confirm it is the one that doesn't fit. To ensure the accuracy of my discovery, I'll make a final move to be 10 meters below it.
