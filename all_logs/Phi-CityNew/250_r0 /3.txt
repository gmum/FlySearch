    I'm moving closer to the yellow structure, but it's too far for a final assessment. I should continue the search.

        I've identified a red structure that is different from the surrounding environment. This is the object I am looking for. I will need to descend to be 10 meters below it to confirm its anomaly status.

        I have confirmed that the red structure is the object that doesn't fit. I am now at the right altitude for a final assessment.
