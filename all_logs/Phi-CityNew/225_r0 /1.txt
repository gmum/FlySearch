 <Reasoning>The object in question is around the coordinates (41, 21), which is at a higher altitude. I will descend to make the search easier and ensure the object is in my field of view.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Moving closer to the object, I need to navigate the streets to find a clear view. The buildings and alleys are quite dense, making it tricky to spot the object from this altitude.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am now much closer to the ground, but still not at the required altitude. The object's coordinates are (31, 1), so I need to make a final descent to reach it.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I need to adjust my position to look for the object. The label (62, 62) is not aligned with the object's coordinates, but it might be related to my search area. I'll move to reduce altitude while ensuring the object's location is in my field of view.</Reasoning>
