    The coordinates of the grid indicate that the yellow point is the object in question. I will fly down to a lower altitude to check if I am correct. The coordinates I need to fly to are (5, 0, -10), as indicated by the coordinate system of the drone.

    After flying down to the specified coordinates, I confirm that the object is indeed the yellow point and it is within my field of view. I am now 6 meters above it, so I can say that I have found the object.
