    The coordinates of the grid indicate that the object in the center of the frame is the object in question. I will fly down to a lower altitude to check if I am correct. The coordinates I need to fly to are (0, -2), as indicated by the coordinate system of the drone.

    After flying down to the specified coordinates, I confirm that the object in the center of the frame is indeed the object in question and it is within my field of view. I am now 2 meters above it, so I can say that I have found the object.

    I have confirmed that the object is the one in the center of the frame and it is within my field of view. I will now reply with "FOUND" to indicate that I have found the object.
