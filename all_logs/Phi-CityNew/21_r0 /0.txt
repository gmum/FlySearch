 <Reasoning>My objective is to fly below 10 meters above the ground, so I will start by flying straight down to the ground level. Since the object is a black truck, it might be hidden among the industrial structures in the image. I will make a few moves to get a closer look and confirm if I can see the object or not. The coordinates marked with a negative number indicate the altitude, while the positive number indicates the ground level. I will move along the grid lines to scan the area below my current position carefully. I must ensure the object is in my field of view before I reply with "FOUND" to confirm the object is found.</Reasoning>
