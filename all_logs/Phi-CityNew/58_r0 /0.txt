    <Reasoning>I will move to the bottom center of the grid to get closer to the ground and maximize my chances of finding the object. If I don't find the object, I'll continue to search in a grid pattern, moving closer in each iteration to the area where the object might be. This method will help me cover the area efficiently, as it allows me to fine-tune my search location while ensuring I'm as close to the ground as possible.</Reasoning>
