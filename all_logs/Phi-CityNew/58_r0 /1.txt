    <Reasoning>I will move to the bottom left of the grid, making the drone as close to the ground as possible. This altitude allows me to cover more ground and increases the likelihood of finding the object or fire if it's on the ground. By flying at this lower altitude, I maintain a safe clearance from the ground while maximizing my search area.
