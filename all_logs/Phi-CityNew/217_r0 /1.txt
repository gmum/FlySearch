 <Reasoning>Given that my current altitude allows for a broad view, I will survey the area in a south-eastern direction to cover as much ground as possible. The point (28,-28) may indicate a high-rise structure or another anomaly that could be of interest.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>From the earlier coordinates, it seems like the region around (28, -28) could be a potential area for an object. I will proceed to the coordinates (28, -28), which should keep me within a safe altitude range and provide a closer view of the area.</Reasoning>
