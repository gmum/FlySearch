 <Reasoning>I need to start my search by locating a high point of interest that might indicate the presence of an object. A good starting position would be near the top of the building. Based on the coordinates provided, I will move to the location (0,0), which is near the top of the building and has a high elevation. This should maximize my viewing angle.</Reasoning>
