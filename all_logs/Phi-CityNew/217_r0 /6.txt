 <Reasoning>Even after a thorough search, I have yet to find any anomalies. I'll continue my search in the general area around (57,0), ensuring I cover as much ground as possible.</Reasoning>
<Action>(57,0,0)</Action>

<Reasoning>Despite the previous search efforts, no anomaly was found. Therefore, I will continue to search around the area indicated by the coordinates (57,0).</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The search is approaching the edge of the search area. I will move slightly to the right and downwards to (57,28) for a clearer view.</Reasoning>
<Action>(57,28,0)</Action>

<Reasoning>Since there's still no sign of the anomaly, I will try a different angle by moving to (57,57), which might offer a different perspective on the anomaly.</Reasoning>
