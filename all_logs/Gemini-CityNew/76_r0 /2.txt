<Reasoning>I seem to be hitting objects when descending. This indicates that I am already close to the ground. I need to move to a location where I can see the construction site and then descend. I will move towards what seems like a road construction site, at coordinates (23, -23), but will avoid descending further for now.</Reasoning>
