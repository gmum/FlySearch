<Reasoning>I need to find the anomaly. I see something that looks like a couple of cranes on a pier. I should move to the center of that pier at (0, -24) and go lower to confirm. Going lower is important because I need to be closer to the object to declare it as found. Also, I will make sure to center the object in my view.</Reasoning>
