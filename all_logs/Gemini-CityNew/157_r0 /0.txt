<Reasoning>I don't see the trash pile from here. I will move to the center of the map and go lower to look for it. I'll move to (0, 0) and go down by 50 meters, to altitude 48. This should give me a better view of the ground level. If the trash pile is not there, I will look around from this altitude.</Reasoning>
