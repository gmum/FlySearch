<Reasoning>I am still having a lot of trouble navigating. I will try to go down to the street level again and examine the area around me carefully. I'll move slightly to the west so that I don't fly into the building that's in front of me now, but carefully this time, I don't want to lose the mission because I fly into a building. I will move down slowly while checking my surroundings. It is difficult to see what is below me right now, but after this move, I should be very close to the ground.</Reasoning>
