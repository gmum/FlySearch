<Reasoning>Okay, I went up. I still see the object on the right roof. I need to be careful while going down, as I want to avoid crashing again. I think I was crashing when hitting the roof. I should move slowly down to the center of the object, which I think is around (20, 20) from the first image. I will move to (17, 17) and then go down.</Reasoning>
