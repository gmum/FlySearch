<Reasoning>I am hitting the building again. It seems I have to go further than (21, 21) to get away from it. I need to be on the street to find the police car. I will move to (21, 21) and descend to 8 meters above the ground. From the image, it looks like the ground might be lower there.</Reasoning>
