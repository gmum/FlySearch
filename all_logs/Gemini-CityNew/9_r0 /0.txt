<Reasoning>I don't see any obvious trash piles in the initial view. I will move towards (-32, -32) since it has more open ground than other locations, and descend significantly to get a better view of the ground and look for potential piles. I will significantly lower altitude so that I can be closer to any potential waste.</Reasoning>
