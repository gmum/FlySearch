<Reasoning>I went too low again, and now I am at 44m. I need to be more careful. However, I do see the object now. I need to fly below 10 meters above the object. The blue canister appears to be the top of the object, and it's in the center of my view. I'll go down to 8 meters above it.</Reasoning>
