<Reasoning>My previous move was a mistake, I should not have tried to go directly to the crowd, but instead should have first moved to an open area, then went lower. I will move to (7, -7) and drop down 13 meters. It seems like the crowd is in the vicinity of that area.</Reasoning>
<Action>(7, -7, -13)</Action>
