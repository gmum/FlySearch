<Reasoning>Okay, it seems like I can't descend while centered on the roof. I'm still at the same height. I will go to (0,0) and this time I will try to descend to 10 meters above the ground. I'm very close to the ground and there are some building features close by, so it's likely I will hit something again.</Reasoning>
