<Reasoning>I almost hit something. I must be careful with descending. I see some stains on the ground, but that's probably not the anomaly I'm looking for. I will move slightly down and to the left to get a better view of the surrounding area and be cautious about not crashing again. I will go down by only 10 meters.</Reasoning>
