<Reasoning>I need to be more careful with the edges. It seems like I'm consistently hitting the walls while trying to move closer to the potential anomaly. I'll move to (0,0) which is more in the center of my current view, and I'll go down quite a bit, since I am currently far above the ground. I'm still thinking that the flat roof with some white things on it is the anomaly.</Reasoning>
