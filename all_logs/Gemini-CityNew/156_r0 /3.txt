<Reasoning>I seem to be having some issues with obstacles. The green object was definitely higher than I anticipated. I will move to (-10, 20) and try descending down to 8 meters above ground level, or 2 meters above the can. This should be safe, since I already tried to descend from this height.</Reasoning>
