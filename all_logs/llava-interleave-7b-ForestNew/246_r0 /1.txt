<Reasoning>Looking at the grid from above, I see that there are several groups of points that are lower than the rest. Let's focus on the ones closer to the ground to see if any of them could be the anomaly.</Reasoning>
行动 (-3, -3, -5)

<Reasoning>At (-3, -3, -5), I found the anomaly. It's a point that's significantly lower than the rest and doesn't seem to be connected to the surrounding points. Let's get below 10 meters to confirm.</
Action> (-3, -3, -5)

<Found>Found it! The anomaly was at (-3, -3, -5) when I got below 10 meters. I am now centered on the anomaly.</Found>

<Reasoning>We have centered ourselves on the anomaly and are now below 10 meters. Let's continue the search slightly to the north to see if there's anything else we should look at.</
Action> (0, -3, -10)

<Reasoning>At (0, -3, -10) I found another anomaly. It's still lower than the rest and doesn't seem to be connected to the surrounding points. Let's get below 10 meters to confirm.</
Action> (0, -3, -10)

<Found>Found it! The anomaly was at (0, -3, -10)
