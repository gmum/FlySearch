<Reasoning> Flying at 60 meters above ground level is not ideal for a close search. I need to adjust my altitude to be closer to the ground to search for the object. I should keep the altitude below 10 meters to be sure I'm centered on the object and close enough to the ground to satisfy the requirements for a "FOUND" response.</Reasoning>
