<Reasoning> Flying at 77 meters above ground level is not ideal for this search. I should adjust my altitude to a lower value to have a better chance of finding the object. Flying slightly below 10 meters should provide a good balance between remaining within my field of view and getting close enough to the object to make a confident find.</Reasoning>
