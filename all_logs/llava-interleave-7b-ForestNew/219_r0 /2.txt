I'm now at an elevation that's slightly lower than the object (14, 14). I'll continue searching in this area, maintaining below 10 meters altitude.

Action: (-3, -3, -4)

Battery and altitude check: (42, 36, 16)

I found the object at position (14, 14). Flying below 10 meters relative to it.

Reasoning: This point (14, 14) seems to be the one that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment. Flying to it and then slightly lowering will put the drone below 10 meters, which is the objective.
