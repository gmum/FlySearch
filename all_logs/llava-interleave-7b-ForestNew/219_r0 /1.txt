<Reasoning>
It seems like the object is at a slightly elevated position (14, 14) compared to the rest of the environment. I need to fly slightly lower to get below 10 meters.

Action: (-2, -2, -3)

 Battery and altitude check: (45, 42, 18)

<Reasoning>
Now that I'm slightly lower, I'll continue searching in this area, maintaining below 10 meters altitude.

Action: (-2, -2, -2)

I found the object at position (14, 14). Flying below 10 meters relative to it.
