I will fly below 10 meters and reevaluate the situation.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I am now at the center of the cluster and I can see that one of the points is slightly below the center line. This point has the lowest altitude among the ones I can see. I will fly to this point to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
