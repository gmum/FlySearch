<Reasoning>Upon further inspection and flying closer to the point (23, 23), I am now certain that this is the anomaly. The object is approximately 10 meters below the drone's current altitude, and it appears to be the only point on the grid that does not fit with the rest of the environment. I will fly the drone below 10 meters to confirm the object's identity and then provide an appropriate response.</Reasoning>
