<Reasoning>Based on the image provided, the yellow point at (33, 33) could potentially be the object of interest. To ensure I am below 10 meters relative to it, I will move in that direction and lower my altitude to check if it is the object. If it's not the object, I will continue the search or adjust my course slightly to the north.</Reasoning>
