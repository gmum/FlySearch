<Reasoning>Upon further inspection of the points on the grid, the yellow point at (33, 33) seems to be the one that aligns with the object of interest when taking into account the altitude differential. I will now fly to that point while keeping an eye on the altitude to ensure I am below 10 meters relative to the object when I reach it. If it's not the object, I will continue the search or adjust my course slightly to the north.</Reasoning>
