<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the current altitude of the drone, I believe the object of interest is the one at (x, y, z) = (-58, -58, -30) relative to this grid. To investigate this point, I will fly to a lower altitude of 10 meters below the drone's current altitude, which is centered on this point.</Reasoning>
