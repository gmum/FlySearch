<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided, the object of interest appears to be at approximately (13, 20). To properly search for the object, I will fly to a lower altitude, below 10 meters, while keeping the drone centered on the object. I will then reply with "FOUND" once I have the object in sight and within the required altitude limit.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Found it! The object is at the coordinates (13, 20), and I'm flying close enough to meet the requirements. I will now confirm "FOUND" and prepare to ascend back to my current altitude.</Reasoning>
