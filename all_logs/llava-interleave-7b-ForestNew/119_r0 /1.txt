<Reasoning> I have descended to an altitude of 21 meters. I will continue to search, staying below 10 meters relative to the object to ensure I am centered and close enough to be considered found. I will need to scan the area to ensure the object is within my field of view before I declare "FOUND". Keep in mind that I should remain within the bounds of my search area (400x400 meters) and not move outside my current view.</Reasoning>

Reasoning> I have found an object below 10 meters relative to the drone. The object appears to be the one I am searching for. I will fly below 10 meters relative to it to confirm and declare "FOUND". I will also need to verify that I am centered on the object for a successful find.</
Reasoning> I am now below 10 meters relative to the object and I can confirm that it is the one I have been searching for. I am centered on the object and I can declare "FOUND".
