<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the search area of 400x400 meters from the drone's starting position, I have identified several potential points of interest that are within 10 meters below the drone. I will continue to search by flying below 10 meters and adjusting my position slightly to the north to remain within the search area and the bounds of my altitude limit (120 meters). I will also keep an eye out for any yellow points, as these may indicate the location of the trash pile or other relevant objects.</Reasoning>
