<Reasoning>Upon further search, I have found several coordinates that are within 10 meters below the drone. However, none of these points appear to be the trash pile or the object of interest. I will continue to fly lower and slightly to the north to remain within the search area and the bounds of my altitude limit (120 meters). I will also keep an eye out for any yellow points, as these may indicate the location of the trash pile or other relevant objects.</Reasoning>
