<Reasoning> Flying at 94 meters, the yellow point appears to be the object of interest. I'm going to descend to a lower altitude for a closer inspection. Flying below 10 meters will allow a proper evaluation of the object's accuracy. I will then adjust my position as needed to ensure I'm centered on the object.</Reasoning>
