<Reasoning> With an altitude of 83 meters, the object remains in the center of the grid, and I'm able to observe it without being too close or too far. I will fly slightly lower to ensure I'm within 10 meters of the object when I reply with "FOUND". I will also carefully adjust my position to maintain center alignment with the object.</Reasoning>
