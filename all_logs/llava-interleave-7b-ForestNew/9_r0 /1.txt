<Reasoning> I have found the object below 10 meters relative to the drone. The object appears to be the trash pile based on its proximity and location within the search area. Flying slightly to the south will give me a better angle to confirm the object's identity. I must remain vigilant and not exceed my allowed altitude limit (120 meters) or get off-bounds.</
