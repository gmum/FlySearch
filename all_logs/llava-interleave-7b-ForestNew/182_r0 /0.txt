<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 48 meters above ground level is not optimal for finding a person. I will need to descend to a lower altitude to search for the person. I will also need to approach the location from an angle to have a better field of view for any potential hidden or partially blocked objects.</Reasoning>
