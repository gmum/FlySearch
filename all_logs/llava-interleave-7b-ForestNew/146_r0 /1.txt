<Reasoning> I have descended to 39 meters, but I still don't see a trash pile at ground or close to ground level. I should continue the search by descending to slightly lower altitudes. Flying slightly to the south (x, y, z) should keep me within the search area and below 10 meters above the object. I'll perform a search with a 1-meter descent to cover a larger area and be closer to the ground. I will also slightly to the south to remain within the search area. </Reasoning>
