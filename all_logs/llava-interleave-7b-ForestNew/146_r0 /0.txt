<Reasoning> Flying at 41 meters above ground level is too high to find a trash pile at ground or close to ground level. I should move closer to the ground to search for the object. Flying slightly to the north (x, y, z) should keep me within the search area and below 10 meters above the object. I'll perform a search with a 1-meter descent to cover a larger area and be closer to the ground. </Reasoning>
