<Reasoning> Flying at my current altitude, I see several points marked with coordinates close to each other. Given the search area of 400x400 meters from my starting position, I need to be cautious not to stray too far from the object in question. I will approach a point that seems to be close to the object, while keeping an eye on the coordinates to ensure it's the correct one. Flying slightly lower, I find a point that seems to be closer to the object (approximately 8 meters above ground level based on the coordinates provided), which is within my search area and my altitude limit. I will move in that direction and continue searching until I am below 10 meters relative to the object.</Reasoning>
