<Reasoning>After flying lower 10 meters, I am now at an altitude of 37 meters above the ground level. I am checking the area around the center point (0,0) on the grid for the object. There doesn't seem to be a clear point that stands out as the object based on the current coordinates and altitude.</Reasoning>
