<Reasoning> I have descended to a height of 10 meters below the object (x, y, z) = (-25, -25, -10). However, I am now considering an adjusted descent to (-20, -20, -5) to ensure a closer center of gravity and better alignment with the object.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have found the object at (-20, -20, -5) and am now flying below 10 meters relative to it. I will reply with "FOUND".</Reasoning>
