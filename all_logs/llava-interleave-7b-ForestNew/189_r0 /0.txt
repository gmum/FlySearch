<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 90 meters above ground level may not provide enough visibility or coverage to find the object. I will descend to a lower altitude to search for the object. Flying below 10 meters should allow for a better view of the area and a greater likelihood of finding the object. I will also adjust the drone's position slightly to the north to cover more ground in the search area.</Reasoning>
