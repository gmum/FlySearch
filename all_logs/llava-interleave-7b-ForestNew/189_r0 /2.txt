<Reasoning> I have descended to an altitude of 58 meters and continue to search for the object. The object has not been found at this lower altitude, so I will need to descend further. Flying below 10 meters relative to the object is crucial for this search to be successful. I will adjust the drone's position slightly to the south to cover more ground in the search area.</Reasoning>
