<Reasoning>This image does not provide enough information to determine the object's location. I will search a grid below the current altitude (10 meters) and to the north (to the drone's starting position) for a suitable point to investigate. I will limit the search area to 400x400 meters from the starting position.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>After checking the area around the current altitude and to the north, I have found a suitable point (x, y, z) to investigate that is below 10 meters and within the search area. I will fly to that point for a closer inspection.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I have arrived at the selected point and I can confirm that the object is indeed below 10 meters. I will fly below 10 meters to confirm the object's location.</Reasoning>
