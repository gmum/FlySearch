<Reasoning>This image does not provide enough information to determine the object's location. I will search a grid below the current altitude (10 meters) and to the north (to the drone's starting position) for a suitable point to investigate. I will limit the search area to 400x400 meters from the drone's starting position.</Reasoning>
