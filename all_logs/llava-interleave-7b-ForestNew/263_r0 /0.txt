<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the object's potential location marked by the yellow point, I need to descend to a lower altitude to check if this is the object in question. Flying below 10 meters will give me a better view of the object and allow me to make a more accurate assessment. I will also slightly adjust my heading to the north to align with the potential object's location on the grid.</Reasoning>
