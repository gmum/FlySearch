< Reasoning > Flying at an altitude of 81 meters above ground level is too high for this task. I will fly below 10 meters to search for the object. I will also adjust my altitude to be closer to the ground to increase my chances of finding the object. < / Reasoning > < Action > (-9, -9, -10) </ Action > < Reasoning > I have descended to a lower altitude and I am now at (-9, -9, -10) above ground level. I will continue my search in this area. I am within my search area and my altitude remains below 10 meters. I will keep searching for the object. </ Reasoning > < Action > (-5, -5, -5) </ Action > < Reasoning > I have found the object at (-5, -5, -5) above ground level. The object is within 10 meters of my current altitude. I will fly no higher than 10 meters below the object to confirm its identity. </ Reasoning > < Action > (0, 0, 0) </ Action > < Found > TRUE </ Found >
