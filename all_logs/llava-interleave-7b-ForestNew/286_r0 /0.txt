<Reasoning> I have descended to a lower altitude and I see several points around the plane that are below 10 meters. However, I need to be more precise to find the exact object. I will search in the grid coordinates (-10, -10), (-10, 0), (-10, 10), (0, -10), (10, -10), (10, 0), (10, 10). If I don't find the object within these coordinates, I will continue searching in a more expansive area.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have checked the points around the plane and I found the object at the coordinate (-10, -10). I am now flying below 10 meters relative to the object and I can confirm that this is the anomaly.</Reasoning>
