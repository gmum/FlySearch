<Reasoning>Continuing my search below the current altitude, I'm now at the (-40, -40) point on the grid, which corresponds to an altitude of 39 meters above ground level. I found an object that doesn't fit the surroundings. To ensure I'm centered on the object and within 10 meters, I will move slightly to the north and slightly to the south, adjusting my altitude as necessary.</Reasoning>
