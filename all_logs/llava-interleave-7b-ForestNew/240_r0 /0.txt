<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the current altitude, I'm looking at the (-40, -40) point on the grid, which corresponds to an altitude of 60 meters above ground level. To get below 10 meters relative to the object, I need to move downwards. I will move in a slight diagonal to approach the (-40, -40) point, keeping an eye on the object and adjusting my altitude as necessary.</Reasoning>
