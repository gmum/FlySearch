<Reasoning>You're currently 14 meters above the ground level and you need to fly below 10 meters to search for the object. The object might be close to the yellow point (12, 23) or any of the other scattered points in the image. Flying slightly to the north (to the point (12, 24)) will give you a better angle to search for the object and allow you to get below 10 meters quickly.</Reasoning>
