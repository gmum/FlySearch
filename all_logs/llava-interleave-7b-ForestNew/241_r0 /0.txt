<Reasoning>Based on the grid and the coordinates provided, I believe the object of interest might be the one at (25, 15, 0). To get below 10 meters relative to the object, I should move south (towards the object) and slightly west (to center on the object). I will perform this move and check if I have found the object.</Reasoning>
