<Reasoning> I have flown below 10 meters and I believe I have found the anomaly. The point (11, 11) on the grid corresponds to an altitude of 11 meters, which is within the allowed range for a maximum altitude of 120 meters. I am now flying directly below this point to confirm that this is the anomaly.</Reasoning>
