<Reasoning>As I am currently at an altitude of 67 meters, I need to move to a lower altitude in order to be within 10 meters of the object. From the coordinates provided, it seems that the points around (-45, -45) and (-40, -40) are likely to be close to or within 10 meters of the object. I will move to these coordinates while maintaining an altitude below 10 meters to ensure I am centered on the object and close to it.</Reasoning>
