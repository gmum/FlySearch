<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the object's potential location, I am moving below 10 meters to the grid point (13, 20), which should put me in a good position to check if this is the object. Flying at a lower altitude of 10 meters or less would be ideal, but I am limited to a maximum of 9 moves and my current altitude is 39 meters.</Reasoning>
