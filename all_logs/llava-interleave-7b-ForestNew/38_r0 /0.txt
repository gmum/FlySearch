<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the current altitude, I need to move slightly to the south to enter a tree line where the object might be hidden. Flying just below the tree line should provide a good starting point for a search. I will also fly below 10 meters to ensure we're close enough to the object to be considered found.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Given the new position slightly below the tree line, I will continue my search while staying below 10 meters. Flying to the yellow point (33, 33) on the grid should bring me into a new area with a good vantage point to search for the object.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>We're now at a new location with a better view of the surroundings. I will fly to the point (16, 33) to remain within the search area and below 10 meters to ensure a proper search.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Flying to (21, 33) should provide a good vantage point to search the area around the object. I will remain below 10 meters to ensure a proper search.</Reasoning>
