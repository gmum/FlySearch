<Reasoning>Drifting towards the center of the image, I see several points close to the ground that could potentially be the object. However, none of them are directly below 10 meters, so I'll proceed with a more thorough search. I'll move slightly to the north to cover more ground without going out of bounds or too high.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Flying slightly to the north to cover more ground without going out of bounds or too high. I've found a point that seems to be quite close to the ground and within my field of view. Flying below 10 meters and checking if it's the object.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Flying below 10 meters and I've found it! The object is at a lower altitude than 10 meters. I'm now directly above it and ready to report.</Reasoning>
