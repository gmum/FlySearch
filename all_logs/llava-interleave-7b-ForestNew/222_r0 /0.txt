<Reasoning> The object of interest is not at a lower altitude than 10 meters, as per the objective. I will carefully approach the area below and to the sides of the plane to search for the anomaly. Flying below the plane and to the sides will provide a good search area without venturing too high or too low.</Reasoning>
