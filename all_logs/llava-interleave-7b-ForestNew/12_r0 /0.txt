<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 80 meters, the yellow point at (54, 54) on the grid might be the object of interest. To ensure I find the object and to search within the limited scope of 400x400 meters from the drone's starting position, I will proceed to fly lower and to the north, adjusting as necessary to remain within the search area and maintain the object within my field of view. Flying below 10 meters and staying below 10 meters relative to the object will satisfy the requirements for a successful search. </Reasoning>
