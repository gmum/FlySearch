<Reasoning> At an altitude of 70 meters, the yellow point at (54, 54) on the grid seems to be the object of interest. To search within the limited scope of 400x400 meters from the drone's starting position and to stay below 10 meters relative to the object, I will proceed to fly lower and to the north, adjusting as necessary to remain within the search area and maintain the object within my field of view. Flying below 10 meters and staying below 10 meters relative to the object will satisfy the requirements for a successful search. </Reasoning>
