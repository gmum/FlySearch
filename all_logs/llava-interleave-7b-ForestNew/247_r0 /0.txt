<Reasoning> Flying at a lower altitude (closer to the ground) would be helpful in finding the object. I'll search in a square area centered around the point of interest (POI) with a lower limit of 10 meters to ensure I'm close enough to make a proper evaluation. I'll search a bit to the north as well to cover a wider area in case the object is oriented differently than expected.</Reasoning>
