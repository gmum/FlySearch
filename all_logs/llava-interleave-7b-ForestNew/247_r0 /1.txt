<Reasoning> I'm now at a lower altitude (closer to the ground) and I see several points that might be of interest. Let's search a square area centered around the point of interest (POI) with a lower limit of 10 meters to ensure I'm close enough to make a proper evaluation. I'll slightly adjust the search area to the north as well to cover a wider area in case the object is oriented differently than expected.</Reasoning>
