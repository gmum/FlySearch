<Reasoning> I have descended to a height of 10 meters below the center point of the grid. I am now closely inspecting the area in the center of the grid. It appears that the anomaly I identified is still present and does not appear to be moving. I will fly closer to the anomaly to confirm its nature and whether it is the object of interest. </Reasoning>
