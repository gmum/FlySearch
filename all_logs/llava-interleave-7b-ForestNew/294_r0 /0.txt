<Reasoning> I have descended to a height of 10 meters below the center point of the grid. I am now closely inspecting the area in the center of the grid. It appears that there is an anomaly in the environment represented by the coordinates (0, 0, 0). I will fly closer to the anomaly to confirm its nature. </Reasoning>
