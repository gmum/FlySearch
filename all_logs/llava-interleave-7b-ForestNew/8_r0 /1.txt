<Reasoning>Upon further searching the area, I have found a point that seems to be closer to the ground and within the bounds of the search area. Flying to this location will allow me to get a better look at the ground and try to locate the object. I will fly to this point and adjust my altitude and direction as needed to stay within the search area and maintain a safe distance from any obstacles.</Reasoning>
Action: (5, -10, -20)
