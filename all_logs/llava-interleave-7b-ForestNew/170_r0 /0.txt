<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 75 meters above ground level is not optimal for searching for an object. I will adjust the altitude to a lower value, approaching the search area, to increase the chances of finding the object. Flying below 10 meters relative to the object should provide a more accurate assessment of the object's location.</Reasoning>
