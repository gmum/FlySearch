<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 95 meters, I have identified a group of points (approximately -63, 63) on the grid that seem to be relatively close to each other. These points suggest the potential location of the object. I will fly closer to investigate. Flying below 10 meters and centered on the object is my objective.</Reasoning>
