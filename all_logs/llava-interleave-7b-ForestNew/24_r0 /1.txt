<Reasoning> Flying at 10 meters below, I have arrived at a point just north of the center of the grid, which corresponds to an altitude of around 20-21 meters. This point is within my field of view and I believe it to be the object I am searching for. I will fly below 10 meters to confirm it as the object.</Reasoning>
