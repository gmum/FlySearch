<Reasoning> Flying at 10 meters below, I have arrived at a point just below the center of the grid, which corresponds to an altitude of around 30-31 meters. However, this point is outside my field of view. I will need to adjust slightly to the north to find an area within the drone's field of view where I can search for the object.</Reasoning>
