<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the object search task, I will move closer to the ground to search for the anomaly. I will start by flying slightly up and then right to clear the area and approach the ground. I will then adjust my altitude and position to be as close to the ground as possible to find the anomaly.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Continuing to search for the anomaly, I will descend even closer to the ground while keeping an eye out for any points that stand out as potential anomalies. I will also consider moving slightly to the left to cover more ground.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I have descended to a lower altitude and am now closely examining the area. I have found a point that seems out of place (x, y, z) = (-52, -171, -5) when compared to the surrounding points. This point is 10 meters or less below the drone, making it the anomaly. I will fly there to confirm the object.</Reasoning>
