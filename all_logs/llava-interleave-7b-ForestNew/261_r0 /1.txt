<Reasoning>After finding the anomaly at (-52, -171, -10), I will continue my search by moving slightly to the north to cover more ground and look for any other potential anomalies. I will maintain a lower altitude to ensure I can examine the area thoroughly.</Reasoning>
\Action>(-52, -171, -5)</Action>
<Reasoning>Upon further examination of the area, I have found another point that stands out as an anomaly (x, y, z) = (-49, -168, -5) when compared to the surrounding points. This point is 10 meters or less below the drone, making it the next anomaly I will fly to in to confirm the object.</Reasoning>
 ACTION( -49, -168, -5)
