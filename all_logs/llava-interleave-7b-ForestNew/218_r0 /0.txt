<Reasoning> Based on the analysis of the image and the coordinates provided, the object of interest is likely to be located within the vicinity of the points marked with coordinates close to each other. To search for the anomaly, I will fly below 10 meters and move in a grid pattern, staying within the search area (400x400m from the drone's starting position). I will also adjust my altitude and direction as needed to maintain a close approach to the potential anomaly.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have descended to a lower altitude and am now centered on the point marked with the coordinates (31, 31). I will continue to search in this area, staying below 10 meters and moving in a grid pattern. I will adjust my altitude and direction as needed to maintain a close approach to the potential anomaly.</Reasoning>

<Action>(-30, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning> I have found the object, and it is below 10 meters. I will fly below 10 meters relative to it.</Reasoning>

<Found> Yes
