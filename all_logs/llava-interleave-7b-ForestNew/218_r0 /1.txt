<Reasoning> After continuing the search and analyzing the image, I have found another point of interest that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment. I will fly below 10 meters relative to it and continue the search.

Action: (31, 28, -5)

<Reasoning> I have descended to a lower altitude and am now centered on the point marked with the coordinates (31, 28). I will continue to search in this area, staying below 10 meters and moving in a grid pattern. I will adjust my altitude and direction as needed to maintain a close approach to the potential anomaly.</
 Reasoning

Action: (-20, 10, -5)

<Reasoning> I have found an anomaly. The object is below 10 meters and appears to be the one that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment. I will fly below 10 meters relative to it and reply with "FOUND".

<Found> Yes
