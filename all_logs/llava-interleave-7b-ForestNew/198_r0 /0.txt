<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 46 meters above ground level does not allow for a clear search of the object. I need to fly below 10 meters above the object to perform a careful search. I will start my search at an altitude slightly below 10 meters to ensure I am able to see the object when I lower myself to that height.</Reasoning>
