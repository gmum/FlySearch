<Reasoning> I have lowered my altitude to 35 meters above ground level and I am now able to view the object. I'm going to fly just below 10 meters to confirm it's the object and then I will reply with "FOUND". I will make slight adjustments as needed to ensure I remain centered on the object.</Reasoning>

Action: (0, 0, -9)

<Found>true</Found>
