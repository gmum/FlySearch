<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the current altitude, I need to move below the 10-meter mark to search for the object. Flying directly below at 10 meters might not be the best approach, so I will search in a slightly higher area to the north while staying below 10 meters to account for any altitude variations.</Reasoning>
