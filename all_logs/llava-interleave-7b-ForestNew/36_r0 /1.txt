<Reasoning> I have found the object at the center point (0, 0) and I am close enough to it to consider it found. I need to adjust my altitude slightly to ensure I am below 10 meters relative to the object.</Reasoning>
 Wahlrad (x, y, z) = (0, 0, -10)
<Found> The object has been found at or below 10 meters.</Found>
