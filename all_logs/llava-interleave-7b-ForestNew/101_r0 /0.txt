<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 54 meters above ground level is too high to be able to find the object with certainty. I need to descend to a lower altitude to search for the object. I should also be mindful of staying within the bounds of the search area and maintaining a clear line of sight to the object.</Reasoning>
