<Reasoning> Still searching for the object, I've descended to a lower altitude and found a point that appears to be quite close to the object (denoted by the coordinates (12, 12, 12)) and within a range of 10 meters below the drone. This point seems to be the object of interest. Flying below 10 meters relative to it, I can confirm that this is the object.</Reasoning>
