<Reasoning> Flying to the center of the yellow point (19, 19) on the grid, which is slightly below the current altitude of 37 meters. This point is likely the object in question, considering the close proximity to the current coordinates and the fact that it's a yellow point, which typically signifies a higher density of objects or a potential trash pile. I'll fly slightly below and to the center of this point to perform a careful search.</Reasoning>
