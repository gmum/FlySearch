<Reasoning>Given the coordinates and my current altitude, I should be able to find the object within 10 meters. I will fly slightly to the south to the nearest yellow point on the grid, then adjust my altitude and position to be below 10 meters relative to the object. If I don't find the object at that height, I will continue searching. <Action>(15, 15, -20)</Action></Reasoning>Found
