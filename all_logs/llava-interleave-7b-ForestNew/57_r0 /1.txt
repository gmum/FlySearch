<Reasoning>After flying to the nearest yellow point and being below 10 meters relative to the object, I have found it. I am now flying slightly above and centered on the object to confirm its identity. I will reply with "FOUND" once I have a clear view of the object and am within 10 meters above it. <Action>(17, 17, -5)</Action></Reasoning>Found
