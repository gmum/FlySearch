<Reasoning>Given the current altitude of 72 meters and the search area of 400x400 meters from the starting position, it seems we have a good amount of space to search without being too close to the object. I will fly to the center point (5, 5, 0) and then slightly to the north to cover more ground and be prepared to adjust my course if necessary.</Reasoning>
