<Reasoning> Let's search for the object. Flying slightly lower and to the north seems like a good approach. We should aim to be below 10 meters and be centered on the object when we find it. Let's move to (4, 0, -5) to get closer to the ground. If we don't find it here, we may need to be more selective with our search area or increase our altitude slightly. </Reasoning>
