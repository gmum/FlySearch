<Reasoning> Based on the coordinates provided and the object coordinates, the object of interest is likely to be in the area around the points marked with (-26, 26) and similar. I need to fly below 10 meters to check if this is the object. Flying slightly to the north is also a good idea to cover more of the search area.</Reasoning>
