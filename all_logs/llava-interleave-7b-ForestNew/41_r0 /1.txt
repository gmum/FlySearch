<Reasoning> Upon closer inspection of the grid, it appears that the object of interest might be near the point (0, 0, -10) on the grid. I will move in that direction to perform a more thorough search. I will also fly slightly lower to improve my chances of finding the object and to be able to center it in my field of view when I reply with "FOUND". I will adjust my altitude to a maximum of 120 meters to comply with the limitations set in the task.</Reasoning>
