<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 62 meters above ground level does not allow for a proper search around the area of the object, which is likely to be below ground level or close to the ground. I need to fly below 10 meters to have a better chance of finding the object and to be able to center the object in my field of view when I reply with "FOUND". I will also slightly adjust the heading to the north to cover more of the area.</Reasoning>
