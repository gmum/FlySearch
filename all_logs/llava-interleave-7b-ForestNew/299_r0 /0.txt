<Reasoning>Based on the image and the coordinates provided, the object of interest is at a lower altitude than the drone. I need to approach the area below the drone to investigate. Flying below 10 meters and staying centered on the object should yield the result. I'll also fly slightly north to avoid getting too close to the object and to search a bit more area.</Reasoning>
