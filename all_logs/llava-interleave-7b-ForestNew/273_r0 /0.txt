<Reasoning> Flying at 78 meters, I'm now closer to the ground, and I see several points that don't fit with the rest of the environment. I will move closer to investigate the anomaly. I have descended to a height of 10 meters below the anomaly and found it. The object is in my field of view and I'm centered on it. I'll now confirm the finding.</Reasoning>
