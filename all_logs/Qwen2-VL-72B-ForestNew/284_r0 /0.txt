<Reasoning>Looking at the grid, I notice a potential anomaly near the center of the image at coordinates (0, 27). I will move closer to investigate this area while decreasing my altitude to get a better view. If it turns out to be the anomaly, I will adjust my altitude to be within 10 meters of it.</Reasoning>
