<Reasoning>My altitude is now within the acceptable range to determine if I have found the target. The red spot at the (22, -22) coordinate appears to be a forest fire. I am centered on the object and my altitude is below the 10-meter threshold. Therefore, I can confirm the presence of the forest fire.</Reasoning>
