<Reasoning>Since the objective is to find an anomaly that doesn't fit in with the environment, I should start by exploring areas that show some irregularities. The yellow patches near (-27, -27) and (0, 0) seem distinct from the surrounding greenery. I will fly downwards towards (-27, -27) first, as it might be the anomaly. If it isn't, I'll adjust accordingly.</Reasoning>
