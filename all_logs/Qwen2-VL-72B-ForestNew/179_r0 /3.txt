<Reasoning>The image shows a clearing with several trees, which could be indicative of a campsite. The drone's altitude is now quite low, which means I am close to the ground. However, I need to ensure that I am not too high or too low in relation to the object of interest. I will lower the drone slightly more to ensure the object is within 10 meters and visible in the center of the view.</Reasoning>
