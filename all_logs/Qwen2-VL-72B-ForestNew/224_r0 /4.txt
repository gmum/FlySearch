<Reasoning>At this closer distance, I can see that the area around (-13, 0) is indeed different from the surrounding environment. The ground is more exposed and there are fewer trees. However, I need to get even closer to be sure. I will slightly move to the west and reduce my altitude further to confirm the presence of the anomaly.</Reasoning>
