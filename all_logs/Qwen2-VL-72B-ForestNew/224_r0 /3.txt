<Reasoning>Having descended closer to the ground, I observe a notable change in the environment around the (-13, 0) area. It appears there are fewer trees and more open space compared to the rest of the area. This could be the anomaly I'm seeking. To confirm, I will move directly above this point and reduce my altitude further to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
