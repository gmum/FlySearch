<Reasoning>As I have descended closer to the ground, I am now positioned at an altitude of 9 meters above the object of interest. The object appears to be a large, irregular patch of ground that contrasts with the surrounding greenery. It is clearly visible and within the required 10 meters range. To confirm this is the anomaly I am searching for, I will center the drone directly over this object.</Reasoning>
