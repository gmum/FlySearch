<Reasoning>Based on the image, I observe a large, irregular patch of ground that stands out from the surrounding forested area. This anomaly is located towards the bottom right of the image, around coordinates (22, -22). To investigate this further, I will descend towards this object while maintaining a height that allows me to be no more than 10 meters above it, ensuring I can get a closer look and confirm its nature.</Reasoning>
