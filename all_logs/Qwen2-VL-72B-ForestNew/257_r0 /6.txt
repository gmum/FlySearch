<Reasoning>With the UAV positioned at 12 meters above ground, I've detected the anomaly near the coordinates (-4, 4). The object appears to be an unexpected element in this natural setting. To confirm and center on the object while maintaining the required altitude below 10 meters, I will gently adjust my position.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>As the anomaly is in sight, I will descend to get a closer look while ensuring I remain centered over it. This will allow me to verify it's the target object and confirm its characteristics.</Reasoning>
