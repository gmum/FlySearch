<Reasoning>There is no visible trash pile in the current image, so I will need to move to a different location to continue the search. The trash pile might be in the surrounding area, so I will move in a direction that covers more ground efficiently. I will move to the northeast, as it appears to be an open area that could potentially contain the trash pile.</Reasoning>
