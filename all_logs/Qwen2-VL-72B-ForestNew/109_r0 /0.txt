<Reasoning>I am currently positioned at a high altitude, and the building is not visible. I need to carefully search for the building within the designated area. I will first descend to a lower altitude to get a closer view and then move towards the coordinates that seem to be more densely forested, as buildings are often surrounded by such areas.</Reasoning>
