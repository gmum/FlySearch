<Reasoning>The yellow area I previously targeted does not appear to be a campsite, as there are no visible tents or clearings that would indicate human activity. I will now move towards the north, to another clearing that might possibly be a campsite, while continuing to descend to get a closer look. This approach allows me to methodically search different potential areas while maintaining a safe altitude.</Reasoning>
