<Reasoning>Having descended closer to the ground, I am now in a position to observe the terrain for any signs of human activity that could indicate the presence of a campsite. The area appears to be a natural environment with scattered vegetation and no visible structures or artifacts. I will now cover the area in a systematic manner, starting from the center and moving outward, to ensure I do not miss any subtle signs that could indicate a campsite has been here.</Reasoning>
