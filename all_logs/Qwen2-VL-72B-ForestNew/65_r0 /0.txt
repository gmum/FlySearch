<Reasoning>There seems to be no visible object of interest at this altitude. I should move closer to the ground to potentially spot the trash pile. I will move towards the center of the grid and descend to decrease my altitude significantly, taking into account the need to stay within the 10 meters above the object when I might find it.</Reasoning>
