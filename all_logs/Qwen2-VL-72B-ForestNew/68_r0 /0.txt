<Reasoning>The image shows a forested area with no visible campsite. I should lower my altitude and move closer to the ground to search for the campsite more effectively. I will move directly south and lower my altitude to be closer to the ground, as this direction seems to have an open area that might contain the campsite.</Reasoning>
