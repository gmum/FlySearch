<Reasoning>At this altitude, I can observe more details. The grid shows a variety of trees and the ground is visible. The anomaly might be something that stands out from the natural environment, such as an object with a different color or shape. I should continue to lower my altitude to get an even closer look and increase the chances of spotting the anomaly.</Reasoning>
