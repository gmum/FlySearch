<Reasoning>The objective is to find a building, and the current field of view shows a dense forested area with no visible buildings. Given the limitations and the need to locate a building, it's strategic to move towards areas that are potentially less forested or more open, where a building might be located. Moving slightly to the right and lowering altitude will allow for a closer inspection of the area and provide a better chance of spotting a building if it exists nearby.</Reasoning>
