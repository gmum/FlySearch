<Reasoning>I have descended further to get a closer look at the area of interest, which is the brown object. It stands out from the greenery of the trees and appears to be the anomaly. I am now in a position to confirm that I have found the object.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Confirmed the presence of the anomaly, which is the brown object in the field of view. Adjusting the drone's altitude to ensure it is precisely centered over the anomaly and within the required distance range.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>The brown object is identified as the anomaly. Now, I will center the drone precisely over it and ensure the altitude is within the specified range for a successful confirmation.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>After centering the drone over the anomaly, the altitude is being adjusted to ensure it is at most 10 meters above the object, as required.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Holding position with the drone centered on the anomaly and maintaining an altitude that fulfills the mission's requirements.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Remaining at a stable altitude relative to the anomaly, ensuring the drone is neither too low nor too high.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Continuing to hold position, ensuring that the drone remains centered over the anomaly and the altitude is within the specified range.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Ensuring the drone's position relative to the anomaly is maintained and that the altitude is appropriate.</Reasoning>
