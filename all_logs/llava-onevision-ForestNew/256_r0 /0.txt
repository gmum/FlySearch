<Reasoning>Given that the anomaly is likely to be on the ground or very close to it, I need to descend and move towards the center of the area to start my search. I will begin by moving slightly north (0,5) and descending 30 meters (-30) to get closer to the ground level. This will allow me to have a better view of the terrain and any potential anomalies that might be present.</Reasoning>
