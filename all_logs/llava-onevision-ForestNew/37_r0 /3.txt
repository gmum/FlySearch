<Reasoning>As I fly closer to the object at coordinates (0, 0), I can see that it is the trash pile we were looking for. It is a large, irregular shape that stands out from the surrounding area. I will now fly slightly above it to confirm that it is indeed the trash pile and report it as found.</Reasoning>
Found.
