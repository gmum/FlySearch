<Reasoning>The map shows a grid, and I will start by flying to the center of the map to get a better view of the area. I will then move in a spiral pattern, decreasing the radius as I go, to systematically search for the trash pile. I will also adjust my altitude as needed to stay below 10 meters above the object when I find it.</Reasoning>
