<Reasoning>From the previous image, I've noted that there are several potential points of interest that could be the trash pile. I will start by moving towards the center of the image at a lower altitude to get a better view of the terrain and any potential objects. If I don't find the trash pile in this position, I will continue to adjust my position based on any additional information I gather from the next image.</Reasoning>
