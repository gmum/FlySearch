<Reasoning>From my current position, I can see the object that appears to be the trash pile. It is located at the center of the image, and I am already at an acceptable altitude to confirm that this is the trash pile. I will slightly adjust my position to the center of the object to ensure it is perfectly in my field of view and then confirm that I have found it.</Reasoning>
