<Reasoning>The object in question is not within the vicinity of the plane. I will begin searching the surrounding grassy area, moving in a grid-like pattern and checking each point carefully. Once I find the object, I will fly below 10 meters above it and reply with "FOUND". I will start by moving to the left of the plane and then expanding my search to the right.</Reasoning>
