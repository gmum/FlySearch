<Reasoning>After moving to the coordinates (54, 27, 0), I will now lower my altitude to 71 meters above ground level to get a closer view of the area. This will allow me to inspect the ground more closely and potentially spot the trash pile.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action> 

<Reasoning>As the trash pile is still not found, I will now move to the coordinates (-27, 27, 0) to cover the left section of the grid. This will continue the systematic search and help to narrow down the possible location of the trash pile.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-27, 27, 0)</Action> 

<Reasoning>Since the trash pile has not been found at the previous coordinates, I will continue the search by moving to the coordinates (-54, 27, 0) to cover the left side section of the grid. This will help to cover more ground and increase the chances of locating the trash pile.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-54, 27, 0)</Action> 

<Reasoning>As the trash pile was not found at the previous points, I will now move to the coordinates (-54, 54, 0) to cover the top left corner of the grid. This will help to cover more ground and increase the chances of locating the trash pile.</
