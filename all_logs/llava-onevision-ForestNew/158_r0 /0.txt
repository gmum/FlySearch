<Reasoning>Given the search area and the limited number of moves, it is essential to systematically move across the grid. Since the object could be anywhere within the area, I will begin by moving to the center of the grid to cover the middle section first. This will allow me to narrow down the search area more efficiently if the object is not found immediately.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>After moving to the center, I will decrease my altitude to search for the object at a lower height, as it is more likely to be visible closer to the ground. If the object is not found at this altitude, I will continue to systematically lower my altitude while moving across the grid.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>As I have moved to the center and lowered my altitude to 61 meters, I will now move to the point (0, 27, 0) to continue the systematic search. This will cover the middle-right section of the grid. If the object is not found at this point, I will continue moving to other points on the grid.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Since the object was not found at the previous points, I will now move to the point (0, 54, 0) to cover the top section of the
