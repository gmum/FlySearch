<Reasoning>Since the object is not visible in the first image, I need to start searching systematically. I'll begin by moving to the center of the grid, which is at coordinates (0,0). From there, I can start exploring the surrounding areas to see if I can spot the anomaly. I will also slightly decrease my altitude to improve visibility.</Reasoning>
