<Reasoning> I have found the person near the coordinates (0, 0). I will lower my altitude to 4 meters to be sure I am within the required distance. I will also slightly go to the north and west to ensure I am centered on the person. I will reply with "FOUND" as I have found the person and am within the required distance. </Reasoning>
