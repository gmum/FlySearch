<Reasoning> I will start by moving towards the center of the grid, as it is a common strategy to start in the middle and then move outward. I will also descend slightly to get a better view of the terrain below. If I do not find the anomaly at this point, I will continue to move in a spiral pattern, gradually increasing my radius.</Reasoning>
