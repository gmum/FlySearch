<Reasoning>Given the current altitude of 84 meters, it's essential to descend further to get a better view of the ground. The objective is to find a building, which is likely to be larger and more distinguishable from a lower altitude. I will start by moving slightly to the north and descending 30 meters to 54 meters above ground level. This will provide a better vantage point to identify any structures in the vicinity.</Reasoning>
