<Reasoning>Given the altitude of 10 meters, I need to continue searching for the object. It seems that the object might be located at coordinates (4, 4). I will move towards the center and slightly descend to get a closer look at the area around (4, 4). If the object is not there, I will adjust my position accordingly to get a closer look at any potential objects.</Reasoning>
