<Reasoning>Given the altitude of 13 meters, I need to continue searching for the object. It seems that the object might be in the center of the image. I will move towards the center and slightly descend to get a better view of the area. If the object is not in the center, I will adjust my position accordingly to get a closer look at any potential objects.</Reasoning>
