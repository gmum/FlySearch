<Reasoning>From this altitude, I can see that there is a distinct object at (0,0) that does not fit with the rest of the environment. It appears to be a set of white poles or structures that stand out from the surrounding vegetation. I will move towards this object to get a closer look and determine if it is the anomaly.</Reasoning>
