<Reasoning>Given the grid, I will start by moving towards the center of the image, as the object could potentially be there. I will also decrease my altitude to get a better view of the ground. If I don't find the object in the center, I will move systematically in a grid pattern, checking each section while maintaining a lower altitude.</Reasoning>
