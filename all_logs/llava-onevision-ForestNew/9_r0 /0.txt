<Reasoning>Given that the trash pile is a relatively small object compared to the landscape, I should perform a systematic search. I will start by making grid-like moves, covering the area methodically. I will descend to 10 meters to have a better view of the ground, which will help in identifying the trash pile if it's within my field of view. If not, I will continue the search, moving in a systematic pattern.</Reasoning>
