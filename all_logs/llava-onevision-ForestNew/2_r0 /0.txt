<Reasoning>Given the smoke plume to the left and the absence of visible signs of the fire in the image, it is likely that the fire is located in the direction of the smoke. To find the fire, I will move towards the smoke, slightly to the north and go lower to get a better view of the ground. If I don't find the fire, I will continue to move in the direction of the smoke.</Reasoning>
