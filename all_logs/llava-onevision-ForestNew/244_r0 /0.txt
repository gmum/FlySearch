<Reasoning> I will start by moving slightly to the west and south to explore the area around the grid point (0, 0). This will give me a better view of the terrain and potentially reveal any anomalies. If I don't find anything, I will continue to explore the surrounding area, adjusting my altitude and position as necessary.
