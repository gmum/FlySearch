<Reasoning>At this altitude, I should be able to see any anomalies that might be present. I will start by moving to the center of the grid to get a better view of the surroundings. From there, I will adjust my position based on what I see. If I find the object, I will fly below 10 meters relative to it and reply with "FOUND". If I don't find it, I will continue to move around the grid, checking each point until I locate the object.</Reasoning>
