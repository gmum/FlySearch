<Reasoning>Given the objective of finding an anomaly object and the need to be below 10 meters above it, I will first survey the area around the plane which seems to be the most significant object in the scene. I will start by moving slightly towards the plane to see if there are any smaller objects near it that could be the anomaly. If no anomaly is found near the plane, I will continue to search in the surrounding area, adjusting my altitude as needed to stay below 10 meters above any potential anomaly.</Reasoning>
