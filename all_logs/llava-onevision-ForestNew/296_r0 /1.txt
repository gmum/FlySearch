<Reasoning>As I have moved closer to the plane, I can confirm that the plane itself is not the anomaly. However, upon further observation, I notice a small object near the plane's tail that seems out of place. It is not aligned with the plane's structure and appears to be a different color. I will move closer to this object to confirm if it is the anomaly.</Reasoning>
