<Reasoning>Given the starting altitude and the objective to find the object at a height of 10 meters or less, I should initially descend to reduce the altitude. I will go down 20 meters to start the search from a lower altitude, which will help in spotting the object if it is close to the ground. After descending, I will move slightly to the north to start scanning the area systematically.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Now that I have descended to a lower altitude, I will start scanning the area by moving slightly to the north. This will help in covering more ground and potentially spotting the object. If I do not find the object in this position, I will continue to move systematically across the area.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Since I have not found the object yet, I will continue to move systematically across the area. Moving slightly to the east will help in covering more ground and potentially spotting the object. If I do not find the object in this position, I will continue to move systematically across the area.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Continuing the systematic search, I will move slightly to the south. This will help in covering more ground and potentially spotting the object. If I do not find the object in this position, I will continue to move systematically
