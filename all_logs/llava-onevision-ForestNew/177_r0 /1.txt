<Reasoning>The object, which appears to be a forest fire, has been located. It is positioned below a red area in the image. To fulfill the objective, I need to descend to an altitude of 10 meters or less while maintaining the fire in the center of the view. I will start by lowering the altitude to 5 meters.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Now that I have reached an altitude of 5 meters, the forest fire is clearly visible in the center of the view. I will now report that the object has been found and confirm that I am at an altitude of 10 meters or less as required.</Reasoning>
