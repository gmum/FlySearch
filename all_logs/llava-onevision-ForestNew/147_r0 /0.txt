<Reasoning>Based on the image, it appears that there is a single building located at the coordinate (0, -23). I will start by moving towards this coordinate to investigate further. If it is the object in question, I will adjust my altitude to be below 10 meters above it. If it is not the object, I will continue the search in the surrounding area.</Reasoning>
