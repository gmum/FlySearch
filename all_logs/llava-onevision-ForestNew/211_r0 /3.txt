<Reasoning>Now, being at 20 meters above ground level, I can clearly see an object that is out of place between the coordinates (-7, -0) and (7, -0). It appears to be a pile of rocks, which contrasts with the surrounding uniform greenery. This is likely the anomaly we're looking for. To confirm, I will move slightly to the south to center the object within my view.</Reasoning>
