<Reasoning>Given the altitude of 31 meters, I can spot a point of interest that appears to be an anomaly between coordinates (-10, -0) and (10, -0). This point is distinct from the surrounding environment, which appears to be uniform greenery. To confirm, I need to move closer to the ground and directly above this point to get a clear view and verify if it's indeed the anomaly we're looking for.</Reasoning>
