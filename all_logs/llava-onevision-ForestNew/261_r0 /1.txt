<Reasoning>The object I'm looking for doesn't seem to be in the immediate vicinity. I will move to the center of the search area to have a better overview. If I don't find the object, I will proceed to search systematically by moving in a grid-like pattern, adjusting my altitude as necessary to maintain a clear view of the terrain. Since I am getting closer to the ground, I will also start to decrease my altitude to stay within the acceptable range.</Reasoning>
