<Reasoning>Given the information provided, I will start by moving towards the center of the image to have a better overview of the area. I will also decrease my altitude to get closer to the ground, increasing the chances of spotting the anomaly. If I don't find the object in this central position, I will proceed to search systematically by moving in a grid-like pattern, adjusting my altitude as necessary to maintain a clear view of the terrain.</Reasoning>
