<Reasoning>From the image, I can see that the object in question is not visible in the current view. I will start by moving to the center of the search area, which is (0, 0) on the grid. This will give me a good starting point to begin my search. After reaching the center, I will adjust my altitude to below 10 meters to be in line with the objective.</Reasoning>
