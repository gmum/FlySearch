<Reasoning>Upon reviewing the new image, I've noticed a potential trash pile at the coordinates (-19, -19). To ensure accuracy and comply with the objective, I will move to the coordinates (-10, -10) to be centered on the object and lower my altitude to 5 meters above it. This will allow for a clear and close-up view of the object.</Reasoning>
