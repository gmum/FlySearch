<Reasoning>The image gives us a clear view of the terrain at a lower altitude, but the trash pile is not immediately visible. I will perform a systematic search by moving in a grid pattern, starting from the center and moving in increments of -10 on the x and y coordinates. This method should allow me to cover the area methodically and increase the chances of locating the trash pile. I will start by moving to (-10, -10) while maintaining the altitude at 29 meters.</Reasoning>
