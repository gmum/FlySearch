I cannot find the trash pile from this altitude. I will descend slightly and move to the middle of the grid to get a closer look. <Action>(0, 0, -1)</Action> FOUND. The trash pile is located at coordinates (0, 0). I will now ascend to the required altitude of 10 meters. <Action>(0, 0, 9)</Action> FOUND.
