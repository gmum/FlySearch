<Reasoning>The anomaly I'm looking for could be either the airplane itself, which is clearly visible and out of place in this environment, or something else that is not as easily noticeable. I will move closer to the center of the airplane to get a better view and determine if it's the anomaly, or if there's something else in the vicinity that might be the anomaly.</Reasoning>
