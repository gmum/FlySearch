<Reasoning>Given the task of finding the campsite, I will start by scanning the area methodically. I will begin by moving towards the center of the grid, as this is often a good starting point for systematic searches. I will then adjust my altitude to get a clearer view of the ground. If the campsite is not visible, I will continue to scan the surrounding areas, moving in a systematic pattern to ensure that I cover all the ground within my search area.</Reasoning>
