<Reasoning>Given the starting position and the need to find a trash pile, I will begin by moving to the center of the grid to ensure I have a good starting point for my search. I will then descend to 20 meters to get a closer view of the ground.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>At this altitude, I will now move to the center of the grid to begin my systematic search. I will start by checking the center and then move in a pattern to cover the entire area.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>From the center, I will now move to the first point in my search pattern, which is the top-left corner of the grid. I will continue to descend to 10 meters to get a closer look at the ground.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-36, 36, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>At this point, I will check for the trash pile. If I do not find it, I will move to the next point in my search pattern. I will continue this process until I have covered the entire area or found the trash pile.</Reasoning>
