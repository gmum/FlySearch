<Reasoning>After flying to the coordinates (27, 27) and reducing altitude, I noticed a yellow object that stands out from the surroundings. It appears to be a large, flat, rectangular shape. This could potentially be the object we're looking for. To confirm, I will move slightly downwards to get a better view and to ensure I am at or below 10 meters relative to the object.</Reasoning>
