<Reasoning>After arriving at the coordinates (0, -17), I can confirm that the yellow object is indeed the anomaly we're searching for. It is a distinct color and shape compared to the surrounding greenery, which makes it stand out as the object of interest. I will now fly slightly lower to ensure that I am within the required altitude of 10 meters or less above the object.</Reasoning>
