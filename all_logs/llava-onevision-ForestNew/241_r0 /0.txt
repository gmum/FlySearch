<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided in the grid, I will start by moving towards the center of the grid, which is (0, 0). This will give me a good vantage point to observe the surroundings and potentially spot the anomaly. I will also descend to a lower altitude to increase the chances of spotting the object from above.</Reasoning>
