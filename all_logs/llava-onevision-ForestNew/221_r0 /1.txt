<Reasoning>As I am currently at a lower altitude, I can see a large object on the right side of the image that doesn't fit in with the environment. I will move towards it to confirm if it's the anomaly.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Now that I have moved towards the object, I can confirm that it is indeed the anomaly. I am currently centered on it and below 10 meters above it, so I will report it as FOUND.</Reasoning>
FOUND
