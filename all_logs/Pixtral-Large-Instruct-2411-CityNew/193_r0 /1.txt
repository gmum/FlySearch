<Reasoning>Given the emergency stop due to flying too close to an object, I will now ascend slightly to avoid obstacles and then carefully move in a direction away from the obstacle while still trying to identify the trash pile. I'll descend again once I'm clear of the immediate obstruction.</Reasoning>
