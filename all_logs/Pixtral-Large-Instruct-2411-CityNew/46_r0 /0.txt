    The current view shows a dense urban area with tall buildings and a street. There appears to be some objects on the street below, which might include the trash pile. It's hard to identify specifics from this height, so I need to descend to get a closer look. Since the object of interest (trash pile) is likely to be large and on the ground, moving downward will help in identifying it. I will start by moving straight down to get a clearer view.
