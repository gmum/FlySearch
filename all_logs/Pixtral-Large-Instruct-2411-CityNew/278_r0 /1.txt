    The yellow object is now closer, and it's clear that it is a large vehicle. However, it doesn't seem to be very unusual for this urban environment. Near the coordinates (0, -12), there appears to be an odd red object that wasn't visible before. This might be the anomaly we're looking for. I will move closer to this object and continue descending to inspect it further.
