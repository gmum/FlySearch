I am now at 10 meters above ground level. The image clearly shows the trash pile in the bottom-left quadrant. I need to position the drone directly above and slightly lower than 10 meters from the trash pile to confirm the find.

This move should center the drone on the trash pile while descending an additional 5 meters, ensuring that the drone is no more than 10 meters above the trash pile. If this is successful, the next response will be "FOUND."
