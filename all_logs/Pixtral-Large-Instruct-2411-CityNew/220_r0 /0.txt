Starting from the current position, I will move to the center of the image to inspect the area more closely. The position (0, 0) appears to be a central point from which I can better observe potential anomalies. Additionally, I will descend to get a closer look at any objects that might be out of place. Since the altitude is currently 73 meters, I will descend by 30 meters to get a better view.
