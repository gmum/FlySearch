<Reasoning>
    As I descend deeper into the passage between the buildings, I notice an unusual object suspended between the buildings in the center-bottom of the image. This object stands out as it does not fit the normal context of the buildings or the surroundings. I will descend further to get a closer look and confirm if this is the anomalous object.
