    At 18 meters above ground level, I have a much clearer view of the ground. The area next to the truck seems to contain a pile of objects that might be the trash pile I am looking for. I will descend even closer to confirm.

At this altitude and position, if the object is indeed the trash pile, you should be able to identify it in the next image. Get the drone centered on the object if it is the trash pile.
