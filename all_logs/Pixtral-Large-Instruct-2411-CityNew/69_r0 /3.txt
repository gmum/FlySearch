    I am now at 10 meters altitude and I can see several vehicles. There is a blue sport car on the right side of the image. I need to move closer to it to ensure it's within 10 meters below my altitude and centered in my field of view.

If the next image confirms the blue sport car is within the specified parameters, I will reply with "FOUND."
