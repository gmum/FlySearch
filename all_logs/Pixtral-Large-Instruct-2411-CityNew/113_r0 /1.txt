    The view indicates an urban area with potential obstacles like buildings and metallic structures. I need to carefully move closer to the ground while avoiding obstacles. I will move towards the more open area in the direction (-30, -15) while reducing the altitude to get closer to the possible location of the car, but still ensuring lots of clearance to avoid hitting obstacles.
