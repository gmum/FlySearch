    I observe that there are vehicles visible in the vicinity, and it appears to be an indoor parking area or a garage. With my current altitude at 31 meters and needing to get closer to the ground, I'll move towards the direction (-10, -21) where the vehicles are more visible. This should help me get a closer view while ensuring I avoid any obstacles.
