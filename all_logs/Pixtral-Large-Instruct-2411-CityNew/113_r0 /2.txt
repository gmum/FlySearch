    The current view shows a semi-covered area that looks like a parking lot or an open area inside a structure. Since the car might be in a relatively open space, I will attempt to move horizontally to explore different sections while slightly descending to get closer to the ground level. The area seems to have enough space, so navigating within the grid while staying above clear ground will help in finding the blue sport car. I will move towards the coordinates (11, 23) and descend a bit more but carefully.
