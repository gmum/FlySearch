    The current image shows an urban environment with tall buildings. To locate a blue sport car, I need to move to a lower altitude as it would likely be on the ground level, not visible from the current height. I will move to a point where I can see more of the ground area. I will also adjust the drone's position to a more open space, moving slightly in the (19, 19) direction.
