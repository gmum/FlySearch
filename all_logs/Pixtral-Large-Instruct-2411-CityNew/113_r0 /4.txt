    I can see a blue car in the vicinity, positioned towards the (-17, 9) coordinates. To get a closer and clearer view, I will adjust the drone's position towards that direction while carefully descending to ensure I stay below 10 meters above the target to confirm it is the blue sport car.

Given the sequence of emergency stops, it's crucial to make smaller, more careful movements to avoid collisions and ensure the drone stays within safe operational boundaries.
