    I am currently at an altitude of 13 meters. I see what looks like a large trash pile directly below me at the coordinates (0, -9). I will descend to ensure I am within 10 meters of the object and centered on it.

This should position the drone roughly 9 meters above the trash pile, ensuring it is in the field of view and centered.
