    The current view still predominantly features tall buildings, and it seems like I might have reached a corner or junction of the urban area. I can see what appear to be some urban infrastructure features in the lower left quadrant. I will move closer to these features to investigate if they are part of a road construction site, but I need to be cautious and ensure I stay clear of obstacles.
