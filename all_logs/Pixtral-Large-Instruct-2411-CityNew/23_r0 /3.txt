    At this altitude, the view is still predominantly urban with tall buildings, and there seem to be some sharp edges and cables which could be an indication of ongoing construction. To get a closer look, itâ€™s prudent to move downward and investigate the area with the cables and structures more closely. I am cautious to ensure I stay within the safe altitude parameters.
