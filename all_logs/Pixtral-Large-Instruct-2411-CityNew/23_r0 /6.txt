    I need to be more cautious to avoid obstacles, especially in this densely built area. I'll move slightly upward and then explore gradually, ensuring I stay within a safe altitude range. I'll avoid large horizontal movements to prevent another collision.

By moving upward, I aim to get a clearer view of the surroundings while staying cautious of obstacles. If a construction site is nearby, higher altitude might help in identifying it.
