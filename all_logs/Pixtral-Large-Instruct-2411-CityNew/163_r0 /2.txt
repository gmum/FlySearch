    I am now at 35 meters above ground level. I can see some road construction equipment on the right side of the image. I will move closer to the construction site and further descend to ensure I am below 10 meters from the object.

Now you should be very close to the road construction site. If the next image confirms you are within the required distance, you can then respond with "FOUND".
