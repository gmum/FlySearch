<Reasoning>I have descended further and am now at 20 meters above ground level. I can see a trash pile clearly in the center. I need to descend slightly more to be at or below 10 meters above it.</Reasoning>

Once you have made this move, you should be positioned correctly to declare "FOUND" if the trash pile is within your criteria.
