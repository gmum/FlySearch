<Reasoning>An emergency stop was triggered because I almost hit something. It's clear that the area is congested with structures that I need to be more cautious around. I should move away from the buildings and towards an open area to continue my search. I will ascend slightly to avoid further obstacles and move towards an unobstructed area.</Reasoning>
