 Given the previous incidents and current altitude, a safer and more effective strategy is required to avoid obstacles and continue the search for the anomalous object. Based on the current image, there's an object in the bottom right that doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the environment.

To continue the search safely:

<Reasoning>
    To avoid any further collisions, I will first increase altitude slightly and then carefully move to the area around the object at (13, -13). This new position potentially contains an anomalous object and will allow more space to maneuver safely.
