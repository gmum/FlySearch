  <Reasoning>The road construction site is now clearly visible and centered in my field of view. I am currently at 29 meters above ground level, which is within the acceptable range. I will move slightly to the center to ensure I am directly above the construction site and then confirm the find.</Reasoning>

Once I am centered directly above the road construction site, I will respond with "FOUND".
