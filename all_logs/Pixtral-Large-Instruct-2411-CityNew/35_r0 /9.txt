    I'm now at a higher altitude, which should provide a better overview of the area. I will move forward and slightly downward to the bottom-middle part of the grid to continue searching for the white pickup truck.

If the object (the white pickup truck) is not in your field of view, continue the search until you spot it or until you have exhausted the number of moves.
