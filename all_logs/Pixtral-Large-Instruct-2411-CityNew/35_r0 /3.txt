    I am very close to the ground now and can see the vicinity clearly. I will move slightly westward and go lower to check the area thoroughly for the white pickup truck.

Based on the most recent image, it appears you might be too close to see the object effectively. You should ascend slightly to get a better view of the area below. 

If the object is not in this image, I will continue searching in quadrants systematically to make sure we cover all possible visible areas.
