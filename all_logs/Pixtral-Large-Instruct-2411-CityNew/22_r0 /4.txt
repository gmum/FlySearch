    I am now at an altitude of 29 meters. I observe an orange glow that could potentially be a fire located near the coordinates (19, 19). I will move closer to this area and also descend further to investigate.

Moving to the area with the orange glow and descending will allow for a closer inspection to confirm if it is a fire.
