    I understand I need to be more cautious when moving in close quarters. I will stay at the same altitude but move laterally to (17, 8) to continue my search without descending further. This way, I can avoid potential obstacles while still looking for signs of fire.

By moving laterally and staying at the same height, I can continue the search without risking collisions with obstacles.
