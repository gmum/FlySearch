    I understand that my previous move was too close to an obstacle. I will proceed with caution to avoid any potential obstacles while still trying to locate the fire. I will move to the coordinates (-17, 17) and slightly ascend to ensure a safer distance from any obstacles.

By taking a safer approach and slightly ascending, I can continue the search while avoiding obstacles.
