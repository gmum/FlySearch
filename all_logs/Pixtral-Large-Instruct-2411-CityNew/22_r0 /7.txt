    Given the obstacles present at this altitude, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate safely. To ensure safety and continue the search, I will ascend higher to 40 meters and move to the coordinates (0, 17) to find a clearer path and then gradually descend again to continue the search once I have a clear line of sight.

By ascending higher and moving to a new location, I can avoid obstacles and continue searching for the fire from a safer vantage point.
