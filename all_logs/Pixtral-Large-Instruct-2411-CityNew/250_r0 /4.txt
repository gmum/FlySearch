    The drone is now 14 meters above the ground and centered on the object at (-9, -9), which appears to be a shiny metallic surface. It stands out from the surrounding environment. I will descend to ensure I am within 10 meters above the object to confirm if this is the anomaly.

Once at the altitude of 9 meters above ground level, if the object is still within the field of view and appears to be the anomaly, the next response will be "FOUND".
