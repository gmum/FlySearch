    The object to the left at (-16, 0) appears to be unusual and might be the anomaly we are looking for. I will move closer to inspect it while ensuring I am at an altitude of 10 meters or lower relative to the object.

If the object on the left isn't the anomaly, here are the next steps:

1. Check the object at the center (0, 0).
2. If not at the center, check the top right at (16, 16).
3. If still not the object, explore further by moving to (16, -16).

This systematic scan will improve the chances of identifying the anomaly.
