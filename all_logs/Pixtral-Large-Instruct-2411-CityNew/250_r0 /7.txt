    The object located at the center-bottom of the image (0, -3) is an unusual yellow item that appears out of place compared to the surrounding cars and parking lot. This fits the description of an anomaly. I will descend to ensure I am within 10 meters above the object to confirm if this is it.

Since the object is unusual and matches the description of an anomaly, if the altitude is within 10 meters above the object and it is centered in the field of view after the next move, the next response will be "FOUND."
