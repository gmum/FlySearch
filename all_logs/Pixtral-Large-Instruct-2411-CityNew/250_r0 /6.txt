    I will move slightly to the right while maintaining altitude to avoid any obstacles and inspect the shiny object at the bottom center, which looks quite different from the rest of the environment and could be the anomaly.

After this move, if the object is within the field of view and I am at an altitude of 9 meters above it, I will respond with "FOUND".
