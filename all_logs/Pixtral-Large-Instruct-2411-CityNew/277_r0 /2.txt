    I am now at 15 meters above ground level and the red truck is clearly in my field of view. I believe this is the anomaly since it's the only vehicle parked incorrectly in the middle of the road. To confirm, I will move directly above it and descend to 10 meters or less from the object.

Once the drone is centered right above the object at 10 meters or less, you should reply with "FOUND".
