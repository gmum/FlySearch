    I am now at 30 meters above ground level. I can see several vehicles and the street more clearly. The red truck near the center-right of the image seems unusual for this environment because it is parked in the middle of the road and it sticks out. I will move closer to inspect it more closely while lowering the altitude to ensure I am within 10 meters of the object.
