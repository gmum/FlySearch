 ```xml
<Reasoning>
    To ensure safety and avoid further collisions, I will first ascend slightly to gain a clear view and then move laterally to explore a different area without descending too close to potential obstacles.

Emergency stop; you've flown too close to something and would have hit it.

Given the repeated collisions, it appears there are obstacles in the way that are not fully visible in the images. In such cases, ascending and changing the horizontal direction might help to find an open area where it is safe to descend to search for the fire.

Since I've already had several emergency stops and it is clear that this location is heavily obstructed, I will try another direction:

```xml
<Reasoning>
    Given the current location is heavily obstructed, I will move in a different horizontal direction to find an open area and avoid obstacles. I will also ascend slightly to ensure safety.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(25, 0, 5)</Action>
