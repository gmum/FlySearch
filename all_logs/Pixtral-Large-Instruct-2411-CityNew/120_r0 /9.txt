Emergency stop; you've flown too close to something and would have hit it.

It seems like I've exhausted the allowed number of moves and unfortunately, I've encountered several obstacles that triggered emergency stops. This limits my ability to continue searching effectively. However, I will suggest a final position that might be close to the target based on the observation of the cones and barriers.

Given the constraints and the obstacles encountered, you may need to reposition or adjust your search strategy manually or consider using additional tools or methods to locate the construction site safely.
