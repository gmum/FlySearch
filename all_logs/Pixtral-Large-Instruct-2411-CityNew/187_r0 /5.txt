    After another emergency stop, I need to reassess my approach. I suspect my current altitude of 16 meters is close to the required range, but I need to ensure that I am centered on the construction site without colliding with any obstacles. I will cautiously descend to ensure I am below 10 meters while staying clear of obstructions.
