    Given the previous collision warnings, I need to re-evaluate my approach. I will move up slightly to ensure a safer descent and then carefully center the view on the anomaly which seems to be a car on a rooftop at coordinates (20, -20). I will continue to descend in smaller increments to ensure safety.
