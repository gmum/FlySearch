<Reasoning>I'm currently at 52 meters altitude in an urban area with buildings and streets visible. There isn't any clear indication of a road construction site in the current field of view. I will move slightly lower to get a closer look and scan the area more carefully. I'll move to the coordinates (17, 17) which is ahead and slightly descend to 30 meters.</Reasoning>
