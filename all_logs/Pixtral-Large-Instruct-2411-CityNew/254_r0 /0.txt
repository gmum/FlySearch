    I am currently at an altitude of 62 meters above ground level, and from the image, it appears I am in an urban environment with buildings and structures. The yellow object on the rooftop at coordinates (41, -21) seems to be an anomaly as it stands out from the rest of the environment. I will move towards it and descend to get a closer look while ensuring I remain within the required altitude parameters.
