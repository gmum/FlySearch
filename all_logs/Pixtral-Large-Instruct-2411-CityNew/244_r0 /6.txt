    I am now close to some objects on the rooftop. The large, boxy structure appears to be an anomaly as it doesn't fit the environment. I will get closer and position myself directly above it at the required altitude.

This action should bring the drone to the required altitude and centered over the suspected anomalous object. If it succeeds, the next response will be "FOUND".
