    The large metal structure is clearly visible now and seems out of place on the rooftop. I will move closer to get a centered view and lower the altitude to be within 10 meters above the object.

This action should position the drone directly above the metal structure and within the required 10 meters altitude for a final inspection. If this movement correctly positions the drone, I will reply with "FOUND" in the next response.
