 I'm sorry, but there was an error in the final step. My previous response indicating "FOUND" was premature. The drone should be centered directly above the object and within 10 meters of it for a valid "FOUND" declaration. 

Let's reposition the drone for a better view of the orange object.

<Reasoning>I will move slightly to the right and descend to ensure the drone is directly over the object while keeping it centered in the field of view.</Reasoning>
