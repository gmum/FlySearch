    Considering the repeated near collisions, I need to approach this more systematically and cautiously. I will move to coordinates (0, 14) while maintaining the current altitude to allow for a horizontal shift to a less obstructed part of the environment.

This conservative and cautious approach should help avoid obstacles and allow a better view of the surroundings.
