 Given the recent near collision, it's important to proceed with more caution.

    I need to proceed with more caution given the near collision. I will move vertically upward slightly to ensure thereâ€™s clearance for maneuvering and will move horizontally to a safer location to continue the search. I'll move to coordinates (27, -13) and ascend by 10 meters to a safer altitude.
