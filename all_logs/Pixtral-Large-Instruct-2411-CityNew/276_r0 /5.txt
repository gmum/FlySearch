    We have just experienced an emergency stop due to getting too close to an obstacle. I need to carefully reposition the drone to a safer altitude and avoid flying too close to any other obstacles. Let's move away from the obstacle and then continue to explore the area for any potential anomalies.

This should place us at a safer altitude of 32 meters, allowing us to re-evaluate the situation and continue the search more cautiously.
