    At 26 meters altitude, I am now close enough to observe the details of the potential anomaly. The object is located on the sidewalk near the building, and it appears to be irregular compared to its surroundings, such as the parked cars. I will move directly towards this object and lower my altitude to ensure I am within 10 meters above it for clear identification.

Last move; if this is the correct anomaly, the next step will be confirming it with the "FOUND" response.
