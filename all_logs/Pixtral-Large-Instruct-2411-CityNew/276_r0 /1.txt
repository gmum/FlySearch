    I am now at 56 meters above ground level. This altitude allows for a closer inspection of ground anomalies. I will move laterally to explore other sections of the urban environment. The parking lot with parked cars and the road intersection area might contain anomalies. I will move westward while maintaining the altitude to carefully observe these areas for any anomalies.
