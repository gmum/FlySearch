    I am currently at an altitude of 86 meters and it seems I am positioned above an urban area. To perform a more detailed inspection, I need to descend closer to the ground while ensuring that I cover the area systematically. Given the grid and the layout of the buildings, I will move incrementally downward and laterally to identify any anomalies.
