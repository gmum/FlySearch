    At 56 meters altitude, I can see the area more clearly. The parked cars, buildings, and the road intersection are visible. However, to properly inspect the details and find any anomalies, I need to get closer to the ground. I will descend further to get a clearer view of the ground-level details.

This move will take me to an altitude of 36 meters, allowing for a more detailed view of the surface for potential anomalies.
