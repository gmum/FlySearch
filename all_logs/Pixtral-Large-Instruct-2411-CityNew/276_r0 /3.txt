    At 36 meters altitude, I can clearly see the environment. There appears to be an unusual object on the left side of the intersection, near the sidewalk. This object appears to be out of place compared to other elements like the parked cars and buildings. I will move closer to inspect this potential anomaly while also descending further to ensure I am within the required 10-meter altitude to confirm its nature.
