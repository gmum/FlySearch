    Now that I am positioned above the area with the potential anomaly, I will descend carefully to get a closer look. I need to ensure the object is centered in the field of view and that I am within 10 meters above it for confirmation.

This will place me at an altitude of 10 meters above ground level. If the object is the anomaly, I will confirm it with "FOUND" on the next step.
