    Given the emergency stop, I need to reassess the situation more carefully. The yellow vehicle still appears to be the most probable anomaly. I will move slowly and carefully towards it while maintaining a safe altitude for now. Once I am directly above it, I can then safely descend to ensure I am below 10 meters above the object.
