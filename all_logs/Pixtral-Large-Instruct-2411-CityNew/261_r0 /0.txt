    Given that the objective is to find an anomaly that doesn't fit in with the environment, the yellow car parked on the right side of the street at coordinates (18, 0) is a potential candidate. Typically, vehicles are not left parked in the middle of the road, making this an unusual sight. I will move closer to this potential anomaly and descend to get a better view. If it turns out not to be the object in question, I will continue my search.
