<Reasoning>
    Another collision has been narrowly avoided, indicating that moving directly towards the vehicle may not be safe. Instead, I will adjust my position to move slightly away from the building on the right and try to align myself more carefully with the yellow vehicle. This approach should provide a better angle and safer descent.
