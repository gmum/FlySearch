 Given the repeated emergency stops, the environment seems to be more confined than originally anticipated. I will attempt to move slightly backward and to the left to reset my position and approach the yellow vehicle more carefully.

<Reasoning>
    The repeated emergency stops indicate that the surroundings are more confined than expected. To avoid further collisions, I will reposition the drone by moving slightly backward and to the left. This should provide a safer approach path towards the yellow vehicle. After repositioning, I will try to descend carefully.
