    I will continue to move closer to the ground to increase the chances of spotting the trash pile. I will move slightly forward and downward, aiming for the coordinates in the middle to maximize the area scanned.

The image now shows an urban area with tall buildings and an intersection. There is a prominent yellow marking on the ground which seems to resemble a trash pile. I will move closer to investigate this point.

    There is a yellow marking on the ground near the coordinates (-14, 14) which could possibly be the trash pile. I will move closer to this location and descend further to get a better view.

This approach will help ascertain if the yellow marking is indeed the trash pile we are searching for, while also ensuring the drone remains within safe altitude and distance limits.
