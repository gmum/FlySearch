  ```xml
<Reasoning>
    I hit an obstacle while trying to get closer to the trash pile. I will move slightly upward and to the right to reposition myself safely to get a clear view of the trash pile while maintaining a lower altitude.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(5, 3, 3)</Action>
```

And then:

```xml
<Reasoning>
    I am now positioned safely over the trash pile and within the required altitude range.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(3, -5, -1)</Action>
```
