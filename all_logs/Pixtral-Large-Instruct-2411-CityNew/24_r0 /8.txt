  ```xml
<Reasoning>
    The trash pile is at coordinates (3, -5). I will move slightly to the left and downward to ensure I am centered over the target, while maintaining a safe altitude.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, -5, 0)</Action>
```

It looks like I only have 1 more move left.

And then:

```xml
<Reasoning>
    I am centered above the trash pile at a safe altitude and within the required range.
</Reasoning>
```
