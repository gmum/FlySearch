    Starting my search in an urban environment with buildings and streets. Currently, I am at 48 meters above ground level. The scene consists of typical urban features such as buildings, roads, and vehicles. The yellow point at approximately (-16, -16) is the most unique-looking feature in this image. I will move closer to get a better view and reduce my altitude to see if it's the anomalous object.
