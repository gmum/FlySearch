    The image shows a grid overlay on a street scene. Since the objective is to find a large trash pile, I need to systematically search the area. I will start by moving to one of the corners of the grid and then gradually move towards the center while lowering the altitude to ensure I don't miss any objects that might be the trash pile. I will start by moving to the bottom-left corner and then proceed from there.
