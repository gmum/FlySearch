    I need to be more cautious about descending. It appears that the fire could be visible from a higher vantage point. I will attempt to ascend slightly while exploring a new horizontal area to get a better overview of the surroundings. I'll move to the top-left part of the grid and ascend.

This approach should help to view more of the surrounding area and possibly spot the fire from a safer altitude.
