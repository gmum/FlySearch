<Reasoning>
Given the previous emergency stops, it's clear the environment is highly sensitive to movement. The object is now centered at coordinate (0, -16) and it appears to be distinctly different from the environment suggesting it might be the anomaly I am looking for. I need to lower the altitude cautiously to get within 10 meters above the object. I will attempt a small descent.
