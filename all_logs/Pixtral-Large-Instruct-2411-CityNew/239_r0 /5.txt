 Given the frequent emergency stops, it appears that the drone is operating in a very narrow or obstructed environment. To avoid further collisions, I will now carefully attempt to move horizontally without descending to survey the area more effectively.

<Reasoning>
Given the frequent emergency stops, it appears that the area might be highly obstructed. I will move horizontally to coordinates (31, 31) to survey the area more effectively without descending, and then reassess the next move based on this new position.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(31, 31, 0)</Action>
```

Following this, I will reassess the surroundings to find a safer path for descent or further horizontal movement to identify the anomaly.
