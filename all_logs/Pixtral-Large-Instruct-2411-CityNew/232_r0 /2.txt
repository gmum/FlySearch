   I am now 11 meters above ground level. The large vehicle is now clearly within view. Given its size and position, it appears to be an anomaly in this context. I will descend slightly to be just below 10 meters above the vehicle and center the drone right above it to confirm it as the anomaly.

Once you provide the next image showing my position relative to the vehicle, I will reply with "FOUND" if the requirements are met.
