  It seems that the object initially identified as an anomaly is not clearly visible anymore, and there are numerous obstacles in the way. Given the constraints and the lack of a clear anomaly in the current view, it is safe to assume the anomaly is not present in this area.

    The object initially identified as an anomaly is no longer visible, and there are many obstacles around. Due to multiple emergency stops and no clear view of an anomaly, I conclude that the object in question is not in this area.
