 I am sorry, but you have already declared "FOUND" earlier. You should have waited until you were centered on the object and below 10 meters before announcing "FOUND". Since you've declared "FOUND" prematurely, the mission is now over.

For future reference, you must ensure that the object is centered in your field of view and you are no higher than 10 meters above it before declaring "FOUND". 

Restart the mission or proceed to the next one.
