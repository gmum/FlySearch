    I am now at an altitude of 10 meters above ground level and can clearly see a large trash pile directly below the drone. I will descend slightly further to ensure I am below 10 meters relative to the trash pile and centered on it.

After this move, you should reply with "FOUND" if the trash pile is in the drone's field of view and at an appropriate altitude.
