    I am currently at an altitude of 53 meters above ground level. Since I am in a city environment with tall buildings, it is unlikely that I will spot a trash pile from this altitude. I will first descend significantly to get a closer view of the ground and then start searching for the trash pile. I will move downward to get closer to the ground and then slightly forward to start the search.
