Now that I am at a safer altitude, I will continue my search by moving to a new area to inspect for potential trash piles. I will try to explore more areas by moving horizontally and then descending slightly to get closer if needed.

I will move towards a new area to increase the chance of locating the trash pile while maintaining a safe altitude.
