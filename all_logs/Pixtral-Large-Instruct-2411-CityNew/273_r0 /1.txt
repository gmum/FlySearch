    The anomaly in the previous view is now clearly visible at the center of the image (0,0). The object is a yellow vehicle, which stands out from the other parked cars. I will move closer and lower to ensure I am within 10 meters of it.

In the next image, if the yellow vehicle is still in the center and I am positioned within 10 meters above it, I will reply with "FOUND".
