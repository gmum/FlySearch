    I am currently at 16 meters, which is close to the 10-meter requirement. The yellow object is clearly visible and centered in my field of view. I will make a very slight descent to ensure I am below 10 meters above the object.

Once the next image is provided and it confirms that I am below 10 meters above the object and it is in my field of view, I will reply with "FOUND."
