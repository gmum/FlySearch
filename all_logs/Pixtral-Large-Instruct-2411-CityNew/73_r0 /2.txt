    The object at coordinates (9, 9) appears to be the trash pile we are looking for. I need to move closer and slightly lower to ensure I am within the required 10 meters from the object while keeping it in my field of view.

After this move, if the trash pile is clearly centered and within 10 meters, I will respond with "FOUND".
