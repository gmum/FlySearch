    I am currently at an altitude of 8 meters above ground level. I am now centered on the road signs "STOP / BUS". However, there is no construction site in sight. I need to move forward a bit more to see if the construction site is further ahead.

This way, we will continue to investigate further down the road for any signs of the road construction site.
