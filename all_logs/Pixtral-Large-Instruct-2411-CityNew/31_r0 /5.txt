    I am currently at an altitude of 8 meters above ground level and have a clearer view of the road ahead. There seems to be no road construction site nearby. Since we are still within the permitted move limit, we can move further along the road to search for the construction site.

Let's continue moving forward to examine if the construction site is farther ahead.
