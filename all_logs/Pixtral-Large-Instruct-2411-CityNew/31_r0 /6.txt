    I am currently at an altitude of 8 meters above ground level. I can see various road markings and objects, but no clear signs of a road construction site. I will move slightly to the left, which will give me a broader view of the road ahead.

By moving slightly to the left, I will be able to inspect a different angle of the road to see if I can spot the construction site.
