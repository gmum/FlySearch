 Given the repeated near collisions, it's clear that the operation is too risky at this point. Also, my previous movements have not resulted in any anomalies being observed so far. 

After careful consideration and in the interest of safety, I recommend aborting the mission to avoid further risk of collision. Here is my action plan:

```xml
<Reasoning>
Due to multiple near-collisions and the unclear safety of further attempts to descend, I am aborting the mission. It is crucial to ensure the safety of the UAV and prevent damage or further risks.
</Reasoning>
<Action>Abort Mission</Action>
```
