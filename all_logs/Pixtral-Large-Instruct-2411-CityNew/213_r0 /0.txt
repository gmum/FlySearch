    I am currently at an altitude of 33 meters and the environment appears to be an urban setting with buildings and roads. I will first lower my altitude to get a closer look at the ground level and search for any anomalies that do not fit the typical urban environment. I will move to the left side of the road to inspect the area more closely.
