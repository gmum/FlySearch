    Now I'm at a safer altitude, and I see a possible anomaly near the bottom right corner of the image. It looks like it might be an object that doesn't fit well with the surroundings, such as a round object. I will move closer to inspect it while ensuring I stay centered on the object and fly below 10 meters above it.
