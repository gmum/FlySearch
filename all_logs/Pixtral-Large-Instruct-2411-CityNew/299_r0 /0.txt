<Reasoning>
    The current view shows an urban area with vehicles and buildings. The anomaly could be anything that stands out from the typical cars, roads, and buildings. Since the altitude is 68 meters, I will descend to get a closer look at the area below and perhaps spot something unusual. I will move slightly to the right and downwards to investigate that area more closely.
