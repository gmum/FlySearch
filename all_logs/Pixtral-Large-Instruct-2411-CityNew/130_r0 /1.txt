 Based on the image, the fire appears to be located at approximately (-12, 6). To ensure that I am within 10 meters of the object, I need to position myself directly above it and adjust my altitude accordingly.

Here's the plan:
1. Move to the coordinates (-12, 6).
2. Descend to an altitude of approximately 10 meters or less above the fire.

Given my current altitude of 18 meters, I'll move to the coordinates and adjust my altitude to 8 meters above the object.
