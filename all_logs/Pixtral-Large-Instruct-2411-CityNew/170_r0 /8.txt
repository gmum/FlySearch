 Given the repeated emergency stops due to proximity to obstacles, it is clear that horizontal movements without altitude adjustments are leading to unsafe conditions. 

However, I have one move left, and I will use it cautiously to try to complete the mission successfully.

I will make a small lateral move while maintaining the current altitude to see if I can spot the crowd from a safe distance without moving too close to any obstacles. Since this is my final attempt, I will be very cautious.
