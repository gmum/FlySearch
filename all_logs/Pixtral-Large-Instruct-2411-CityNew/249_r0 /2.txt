    The black object in the road is becoming clearer. It definitely seems out of place in this urban environment. I will move directly above it and descend further to get within the required 10 meters range.

If the drone's altitude is adjusted correctly, I will respond with "FOUND" if the object is clearly visible and centered in the next image.
