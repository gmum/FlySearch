    The image shows a mix of urban structures and roads. Given the current altitude of 54 meters, it is unlikely that I can spot a crowd from this height. I will descend significantly to get a closer view of the ground and observe areas that could potentially have a crowd. Moving closer to the ground will also help in centering on the object if found.
