    I was too close to an obstacle and had to stop. I am currently at 63 meters above ground level. To avoid hitting any obstacles again and to continue the search safely, I will move sideways and slightly descend, ensuring a clear path. This will allow me to explore new areas while maintaining a safe altitude.
