 Given the repeated emergency stops, it's clear that continuing the search in this highly obstructed environment is impractical and unsafe. The drone is likely in a densely built-up urban area, which presents significant risks for collision. At this point, the best course of action is to abort the mission to avoid further damage or accidents.
