 It seems like navigating this area safely is extremely challenging. I will have to abort the plan to descend further and instead focus on keeping the drone safe and finding a less obstructed path.

<Reasoning>
    Continuing to navigate through this dense urban environment at lower altitudes has proven to be very risky. Instead of descending further, I will reposition the drone upward to a safer altitude while looking for a clearer path.

The priority now is to ascend to a safer altitude where obstructions are less likely.
