<Reasoning>Iâ€™m now at a lower altitude and closer to the intersection. I will move towards the bottom right section at (20, -20) to see if there are any anomalies in that area.</Reasoning>
<Action>(20, -20, -10)</Action>
```

I will keep descending and covering more areas until I either spot an anomaly or cover the required search area.
