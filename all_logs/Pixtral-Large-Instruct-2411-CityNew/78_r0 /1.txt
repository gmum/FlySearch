    Now at 60 meters, I can start to identify vehicles more clearly. There are several vehicles visible on the road. I will move closer to the coordinates (20, 20) to inspect the darker-colored vehicles, which might include the blue sports car. I will also descend further to 30 meters to get a closer look.
