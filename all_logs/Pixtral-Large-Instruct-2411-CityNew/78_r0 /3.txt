    From this vantage point, the vehicle at coordinates (0, 6) appears to be a blue sports car. I will descend to get within the required altitude range of 10 meters or less above the object to ensure itâ€™s in my field of view and centered.

After this action, if the car is confirmed to be blue and centered in the field of view, I will respond with "FOUND."
