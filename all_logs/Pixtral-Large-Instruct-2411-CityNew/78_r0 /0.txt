    I am currently at an altitude of 96 meters, which is too high to accurately identify the blue sports car. I will descend significantly to get a closer look at the ground and potential objects of interest. I will move to the coordinates (32, -32) to explore a different part of the grid and adjust my altitude to 60 meters to start a more detailed search.
