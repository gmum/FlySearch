 Given the frequency of emergency stops, we need to adopt a more cautious approach. Here, the obstructions seem less dense, but careful navigation is still required. Since we are still at a relatively high altitude, let's first ascend a little to ensure clearance from nearby structures and then move forward to continue the search.

The current altitude is 30 meters, and we need to avoid obstacles to safely navigate and find the fire. I will ascend slightly to ensure clearance and then move forward to survey the area. This should provide a clearer pathway and reduce the risk of collisions.
