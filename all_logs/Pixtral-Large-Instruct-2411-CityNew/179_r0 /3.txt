 It appears we are in a challenging situation with many obstacles. Given that our current altitude is 34 meters and that descending further to find the fire while avoiding obstacles is critical, we need a different strategy.

Let's try moving backward to clear the immediate obstacles and then descending cautiously to get a better view of whatâ€™s below.

Given the current location with multiple obstacles and an altitude of 34 meters, it is clear that we cannot safely descend here. I will move backward to clear the obstacles and then descend to get a better view of the ground and continue the search for the fire.
