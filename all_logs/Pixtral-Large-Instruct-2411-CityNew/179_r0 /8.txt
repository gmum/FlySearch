 Given the repeated near-collisions, we need to adjust our strategy to navigate safely. We will move backward to clear the area in front of us and then ascend further to get a better vantage point and descend cautiously.

To ensure safety, I will move backward to clear any immediate obstacles and then ascend significantly to get a better overview of the area. From a higher altitude, we can better assess the environment and decide our next move safely.

This move should help us clear the immediate obstacles and gain a better perspective of the area. From there, we can plan our descent more carefully to continue the search for the fire.
