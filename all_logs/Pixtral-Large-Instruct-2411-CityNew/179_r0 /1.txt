I was too close to an obstacle and had to perform an emergency stop. My current altitude is 34 meters above ground level. To ensure safety and continue the search effectively, I will ascend slightly and move forward while maintaining a safe distance from potential obstacles. This will allow me to better survey the area and avoid collisions while searching for the fire.
