    I have identified the object that does not fit in with the rest of the environment. It appears to be a motorcycle situated in the area around (12, 23). To confirm this, I will descend slowly and carefully to ensure I am within 10 meters above the object before confirming it as found.

    I have positioned the drone directly above the object at less than 10 meters altitude. I can confirm that the motorcycle is the anomaly in the environment.
