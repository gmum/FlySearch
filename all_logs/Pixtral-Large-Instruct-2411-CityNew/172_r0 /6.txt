Given the continued emergency stops, it's clear that the current approach isn't safe. I need to rethink the strategy. The area seems to have multiple obstacles, so ascending further will provide a better viewpoint and avoid any obstacles. I will ascend to an altitude of 61 meters and keep my current position stable to have a better look around.
