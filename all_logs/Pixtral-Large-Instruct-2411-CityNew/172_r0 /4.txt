Given the multiple emergency stops, it's clear that the area immediately below and around the current position is obstructed. I will ascend to a higher altitude to gain a broader view of the area and then move to a different position to continue the search for the white sports car. I'll move to coordinates (31, -31) and ascend an additional 10 meters to 56 meters.
