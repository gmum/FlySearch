 I'm sorry, you can no longer move. You have reached the end of your search, and I must inform you that your mission has failed.

Here are the reasons for failure:
1. **Collision Warning**: You received a warning for flying too close to an object, which would have resulted in a collision.
2. **Car Not Found**: Despite being able to move, you did not find the white sports car within the 9 allotted moves and within the proper altitude constraints.

Please use this experience to improve your navigation and object identification skills for future missions.
