<Reasoning>I am now close enough to identify the white car. I will adjust my position to be directly above it and descend further to ensure I am within the required altitude.</Reasoning>
<Action>(11, 6, -8)</Action>
```

After executing this command, if the white car is within the field of view and clearly identifiable as the target, and if the drone's altitude is below 10 meters above the car, the response should be "FOUND."
