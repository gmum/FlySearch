    I am now at 15 meters altitude and have a clear view of the object. The red car in the center appears to be the anomaly as it is out of place on the rooftop. I will descend to just below 10 meters to get a closer inspection.

Once you confirm the altitude, I will respond with "FOUND" if the conditions are met.
