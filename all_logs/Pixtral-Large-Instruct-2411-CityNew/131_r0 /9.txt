 I apologize, but due to the repeated emergency stops and the constraints on the number of moves, the mission to locate the road construction site cannot be completed at this time. 

To be more efficient in future, here are some suggestions:

1. **Safety Margin**: Maintain a safer distance from obstacles and the ground to prevent emergency stops.
2. **Clearance Check**: Before making a move, evaluate if the path is clear of obstacles.
3. **Coordinate Movements**: Plan movements to minimize the risk of hitting obstacles.

The mission must be terminated early as we've reached the maximum number of moves allowed, and safety has been repeatedly compromised.
