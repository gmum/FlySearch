 ### Emergency stop: You've flown too close to the light pole.

<Reasoning>
    I need to move away from the light pole immediately for safety. I will move to the left and slightly backward while increasing the altitude to avoid hitting it. After ensuring a safe distance, I will resume the search for the road construction site.
