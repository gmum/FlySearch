  ```xml
<Reasoning>I will descend further and move to the right to examine the objects closely for a better view of the vehicles on the right side of the grid.</Reasoning>
<Action>(18, 0, -5)</Action>
```

After making this move, I will be directly above an object that looks like a police car. Assuming it is indeed the police car, I will further lower the altitude to be within 10 meters of the object and report "FOUND."

```xml
<Reasoning>There is a potential police car directly below. I will lower the altitude to be within 10 meters and confirm.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -18)</Action>
```

If the object is confirmed to be the police car, I will reply with "FOUND" once I'm within 10 meters of it.
