<Reasoning>
    The current view displays a typical urban scene with parked cars, a road, and buildings. However, there are no apparent anomalies in the center of the view. I will lower the altitude to get a closer look at the ground level to see if there are any anomalies hidden by buildings or cars. I will also move slightly to the left to scan a different part of the road and sidewalk.
