    At an altitude of 10 meters above ground level, the view is much clearer. There is a person leaning against a pole and other regular urban objects. The closest anomaly seems to be a bag on the ground near the pole. I will position the drone closer to this bag and at a lower altitude to determine if this is the anomalous object.
