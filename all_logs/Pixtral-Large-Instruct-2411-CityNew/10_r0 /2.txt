    I have descended to 31 meters above ground level. From this height, I can see vehicles more clearly. The white pickup truck is not directly visible in the center, so I will proceed to move towards the left where multiple vehicles are parked. By moving closer, I will be able to have a better view and identify if the truck is among them.
