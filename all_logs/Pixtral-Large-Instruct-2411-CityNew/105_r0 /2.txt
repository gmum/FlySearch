    I am at 10 meters above ground level and have spotted what appears to be a fire in the object at coordinates (0, -7). I need to get closer to ensure detection and to place the object in the center of my field of view. I will move directly towards the object and slightly descend to ensure I am within the required 10 meters above the object.

Let me know if you now see the fire clearly in the center of your field of view and at the correct altitude.
