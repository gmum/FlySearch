    As I descend further, the object at (0, -31) is more clearly visible, and it appears to be a yellow vehicle, which does seem to be an anomaly in this urban setting. I need to get even closer to be sure. I will move directly above it and descend to below 10 meters to confirm.

If the target object isn't the yellow vehicle, I will reassess the situation and investigate other potential anomalies.
