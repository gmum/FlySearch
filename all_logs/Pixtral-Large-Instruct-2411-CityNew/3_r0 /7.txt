 Given the repeated collisions and the obvious constraints of the environment, it appears to be a very dense urban area with tall buildings that are obstructing safe navigation and descent. 

Considering I only have a few moves left, it is important to be strategic to maximize the chances of locating the fire.

    From the current altitude of 62 meters, I will ascend further to get a clearer overview of the area and attempt to identify open spaces or rooftops where the fire might be more visible. Moving diagonally to the coordinate (41, -41) will allow me to cover new ground while ascending.
