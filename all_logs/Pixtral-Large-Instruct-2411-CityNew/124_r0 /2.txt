<Reasoning>I encountered an obstacle in the previous move. I will adjust my strategy to avoid further obstacles. I see an alleyway to the left and another area further down the street. I will move towards the alleyway but maintain a cautious altitude to avoid hitting anything. The current field of view suggests there might be a trash pile visible at coordinates (10, -10), so I'll fly there while keeping altitude low.</Reasoning>
