In this initial view, I observe a rooftop environment with various structures and objects. The most notable potential anomaly is at coordinates (26, -26). It appears to be an irregular shape that could be the object I am tasked with finding. I will descend directly towards this point to get a closer look and check if it is the anomaly.
