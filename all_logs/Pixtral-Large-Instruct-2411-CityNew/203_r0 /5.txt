    I see a distinct object at coordinates (-12, -12). I will move closer to it, ensuring I remain above 10 meters relative to the object and stay centered on it.

When you provide the next image, I will check if the drone is within 10 meters above the object, and if it is in my field of view, I will reply with "FOUND".
