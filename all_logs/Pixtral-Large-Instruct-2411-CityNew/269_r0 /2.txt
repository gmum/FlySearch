Now at a closer altitude, I observe an unusual object directly beneath the drone that stands out from its environment. It appears to be a car positioned under the shadow of the building in a way that seems out of place. I need to descend further to inspect it closely while keeping it centered in my view to confirm if it is the anomaly.
