The object, which appears to be a car, stands out in the current view and does not fit with the rest of the environment. It appears to be an anomaly. I will descend slightly more to be just under 10 meters relative to the object, ensuring it remains centered in my field of view.

The image now shows the car more clearly and the drone is at 10 meters above the car.
