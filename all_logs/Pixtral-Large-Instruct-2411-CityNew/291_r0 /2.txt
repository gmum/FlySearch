    I need to get even closer to the ground to inspect the objects more carefully. I'm going to move to (33, 16) to center myself above the rooftop with multiple objects, and descend closer to get a good look at any potential anomalies.

Once I get closer, I will check if any of the objects on the rooftop are the anomalies Iâ€™m looking for.
