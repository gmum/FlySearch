    I am almost at the correct altitude to closely inspect the anomalies. I will position myself to observe the buildings and rooftops to identify if there is an object that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment.

From this altitude, I'll be able to carefully observe the buildings and rooftops for any anomalous objects. I will particularly focus on the buildings and their rooftops in this view to see if there is any unusual object present.
