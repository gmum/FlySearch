    The current position does not show the anomaly clearly. Therefore, I will move back towards the previously observed possible anomaly (the mechanical equipment on the rooftop). Given the complexity of the urban environment and the need to avoid collisions, I will maneuver cautiously to get back to the anomaly's position.
