    Having descended to 16 meters above ground level, I am now close enough to inspect the area directly. I will move to the lower right quadrant to get a better view of the object that appears to be on the rooftop, which seems to be the anomaly. I will focus on ensuring the object is centered and within the 10-meter threshold.
