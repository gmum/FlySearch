<Reasoning>In this initial view, the area is mostly composed of docked ships, water, and the dock itself. An anomaly might be something unusual, such as an object that doesn't fit with the regular pattern of the dock and ships. The yellow marking or any peculiar object on the concrete area might be a good place to start the inspection. I will lower the altitude and move towards the possible anomaly to get a better view.</Reasoning>
