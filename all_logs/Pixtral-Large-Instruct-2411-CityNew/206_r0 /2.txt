    Now that I am closer to the vehicle, I can clearly see that it is indeed an anomaly in this environment. I will descend further and position myself directly above it to ensure I am within the required 10 meters or less.

After this action, check the new image to see if the drone is directly above the vehicle and less than or equal to 10 meters from it. If yes, respond with "FOUND".
