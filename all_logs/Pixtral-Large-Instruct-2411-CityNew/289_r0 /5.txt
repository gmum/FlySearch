    I need to re-evaluate my approach due to the frequent emergency stops. The environment is heavily cluttered, so I must proceed with extreme caution. Instead of moving directly to potential anomalies, I will try to maneuver more conservatively around the environment. I will move slightly to the left and lower my altitude a bit to survey from a different angle.
