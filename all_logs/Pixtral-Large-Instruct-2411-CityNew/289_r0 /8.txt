    I am now closer to the large white vehicle. I need to position myself directly above it to confirm it's the anomaly. I will move horizontally to center myself above the vehicle and then descend further to confirm.

This move should place me more centrally above the vehicle. Depending on what I observe in the next image, I might descend further to confirm the anomaly.
