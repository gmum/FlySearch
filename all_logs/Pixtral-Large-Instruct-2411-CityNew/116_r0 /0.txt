 Given the instructions and the image provided, I need to carefully approach potential areas where a road construction site might be located. From the image, areas with potential for road construction are where there are visible disruptions on the road or nearby open spaces where construction materials might be stored.

I will start by moving closer to the area that looks like a construction site or a potential site for construction activity. The area towards the bottom right (coordinates around (61, -61)) looks like a good candidate due to its open space and surrounding structures.

Here is my reasoning and action:

<Reasoning>
    The area towards the bottom right (coordinates around (61, -61)) appears to be a potential construction site due to its open space and surrounding structures. I will move closer to this area and descend to get a better view.
