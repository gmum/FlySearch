    The drone is close to the rooftop, and I see what appears to be an anomaly at the bottom center of the view, near coordinates (0, -28). To avoid further collision risks, I'll cautiously move in to investigate this anomaly and ensure the drone is within 10 meters above it to confirm if itâ€™s the object in question.
