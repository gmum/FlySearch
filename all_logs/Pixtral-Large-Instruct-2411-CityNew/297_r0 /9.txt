 Given the consistent issues with collision detection, I will move to a safe spot slightly further away from the potential obstacles and then attempt another controlled descent.

```xml
<Reasoning>Moving to a safer location to establish a clear line of sight to the target area. After reaching a safe position, I will slowly descend and approach the area again.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-12, -12, 0)</Action>
```

Wait to receive confirmation of the new position before planning the next move.
