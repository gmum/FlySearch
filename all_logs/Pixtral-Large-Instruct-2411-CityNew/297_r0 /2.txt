<Reasoning>After descending to 46 meters, the object in question, the vehicle in the middle of the street at coordinates (0, -31), is now more clearly visible. I need to ensure I am within the required 10 meters for a detailed inspection while keeping the object centered in my field of view.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, -31, -36)</Action>

This action should position the UAV at around 10 meters above the vehicle, allowing for a detailed inspection.
