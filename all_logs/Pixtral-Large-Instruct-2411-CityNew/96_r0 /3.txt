  ```xml
<Reasoning>I am getting closer to the object of interest at coordinates (0, -29) which might be a trash pile. I will move closer and lower again to confirm it.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, -15, -5)</Action>
```

This move will bring the drone closer and slightly lower, ensuring a better view to confirm whether the object is indeed the trash pile.
