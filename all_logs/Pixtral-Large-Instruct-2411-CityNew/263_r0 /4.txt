    Upon reevaluating, the object on the ledge at (-17, 9) appears to be an air conditioning unit, which is quite common. The more unusual object is the white and brown item lying on the road at approximately (17, -9). It does not fit naturally with its surroundings. I will descend further to inspect it closely.
