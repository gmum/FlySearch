 It appears Iâ€™ve made an error in identifying the anomaly. The mannequin is not in view, hence I need to continue the search.

I will continue to move and look for the object.

```xml
<Reasoning>
    The anomaly is not located at (-3, 7). I will continue to search and move to the left side to inspect those rooftops.
