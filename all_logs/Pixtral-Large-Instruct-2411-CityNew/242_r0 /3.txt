    At this altitude, I can clearly inspect the rooftops for any anomalies. I will move slightly to the right to inspect the area around the coordinates (-7, 3).

The object in question is the mannequin sitting in a chair on the rooftop, which doesn't fit in with the urban environment.

Since it is not in the current field of view, you need to move closer to it.
