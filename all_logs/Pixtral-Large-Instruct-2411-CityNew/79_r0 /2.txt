    The potential trash pile is now more visible, located at coordinates (9, -18). I will descend further to ensure I am within the required altitude range of 10 meters or less above the object.

This should bring the drone to around 9 meters above the ground, which, if the object is indeed the trash pile, will ensure it's within the visual field and altitude requirement.
