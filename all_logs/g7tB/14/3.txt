Alright, it seems I have been unable to locate the vehicle within the current view. I will continue searching by flying forward (towards the horizon from the grid's perspective), trying to see if I can spot the yellow pickup truck from a different angle.

<Reasoning>I'm not seeing the yellow vehicle in the grid, so I need to take the drone forward and use the available search area to find what we're looking for. If it's in the lower area outside the current view, it will appear when I change the perspective.</Reasoning>
