I can't see the yellow pickup truck in that image, let's carefully search the 500x500m area to try to locate it. I'll start moving downwards and left from the current position.

<Reasoning>I need to search further to make sure I don't miss anything. A yellow truck might be anywhere in this 500x500m zone, so I'll cautiously check the lower part of the grid.</Reasoning>
