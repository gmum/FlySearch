Sorry, the provided image is not showing the entire area I need to search. The area where the yellow pickup truck might be located is beyond what you are showing. 

For instance, if you look at me in the top of the image, my current perspective or the drone camera is looking at the bottom of this picture. Therefore, even though you cannot see it, I continue to fly downwards and towards left in this scenario, searching for the truck.

<Reasoning>I am flying down, towards the left as I have seen no other truck other than the one you mentioned as possible. I will continue to do so.</Reasoning>
