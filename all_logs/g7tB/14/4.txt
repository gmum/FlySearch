Apologies for the confusion, but based on the new image, it appears you have moved beyond the center of the grid. The yellow pickup truck should be located somewhere in the center of the 500x500m area within the grid.

In the image, I see a yellow point, but it is not clear from this location if it is the yellow pickup truck. However, considering that you want to minimize the distance to the truck, I will now fly towards the truck that's in the yellow point.

<Reasoning>Based on the position and my previous moves, it appears I have overshot the target since it should be within the grid. So, I'm heading towards the yellow point that seems close to the target. This way, I can minimize the distance. Even if this one is not it, we will continue searching within the grid boundaries.</Reasoning>
