<Reasoning>I am looking for a yellow truck, which seems to be located inside a parking lot enclosed by a multi-story building. The truck is somewhat aligned north, so I will move closer to it while also going towards the north.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>By flying closer to the center of the building, I can focus on the area where the yellow truck might be located. Additionally, moving north should bring me closer to the grid of coordinates where the truck is potentially located.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The yellow truck seems to be more closely located towards the northern grid coordinates than the center grid coordinates. Hence, I need to move more towards the north to further pinpoint the truck's location within the grid.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>It seems like none of the previous moves have allowed me a good view of the yellow vehicle. In order to see it more clearly, I should go to the bottom-right part of the building grid coordinates, where I might be able to see it above the cars parked vertically.</Reasoning>
