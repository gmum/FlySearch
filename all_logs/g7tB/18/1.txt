<Reasoning>The point indicated in the image is at coordinate (x, y, z) = (11, 7, -30). This is an integer grid layout, so the point at the center should follow the pattern of (0, 0) for the top-middle, then (x, y) for other points - following the order of rows and columns starting from the top left. As the yellow point is at (11, 7), it's not at the center of the grid but at a random point within the view. So, to reach the center, I will move to (27, 27).</Reasoning>
