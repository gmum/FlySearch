<Reasoning>The yellow pickup truck is centered at coordinates (27, 27). As the grid is set in the order of [x, y], (x1, y1) is on the top, (x2, y2) is on the bottom, (x, y-1) is on the left, and (x, y+1) is on the right - all with x ranging from 0 to 4 and y ranging from 0 to 4. Hence, the center is at (27, 27).</Reasoning>
