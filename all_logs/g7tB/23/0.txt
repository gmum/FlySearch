<Reasoning>I am flying over the city, currently hovering over a grid marked in the top right, which seems to be a parking area. There is a lot of cars spread across the area, which makes it difficult to spot a single yellow pickup truck. The next grid to move to, (-30, 0, -30), is located to the left and in a different section, this might reveal the truck if it is parked there.</Reasoning>
