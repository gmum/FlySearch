<Reasoning>The yellow pickup truck should be located within the center 500x500m area of the city grid. I need to perform a search in this area, focusing on the densest central portion of the city grid to increase my chances of finding the vehicle. The coordinate (0, 18) is located in the center of the grid, so I'll use that as my starting point.</Reasoning>
