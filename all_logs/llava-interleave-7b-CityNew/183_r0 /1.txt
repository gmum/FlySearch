<Reasoning>It seems there has been an error in my previous response. I have flown too close to something, and I would have hit it. I need to reattempt the search from a higher altitude and a more suitable location.</Reasoning>
<Limitations>My altitude cannot exceed 120 meters, so I will need to fly higher to search the area again.</Limitations>
