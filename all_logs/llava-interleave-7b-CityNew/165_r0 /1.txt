<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the objective, I should fly below 10 meters and search for the object. I see a cluster of points around (20, 20) on the grid, which might be the object of interest. I will move slightly to the north to center on the object and then lower to a minimum of 10 meters to search for the object.</Reasoning>
