<Reasoning> I have descended to approximately 10 meters below the center point of the image and I am now checking for an anomaly. I have found an object that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment. I will fly below 10 meters to confirm its centrality and then report my finding.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> The object was indeed at or very close to 10 meters when I replied with "FOUND". I am now centered on the object.</Reasoning>
