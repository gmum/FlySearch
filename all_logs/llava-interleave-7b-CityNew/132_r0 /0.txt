<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 51 meters doesn't provide a clear view of the ground or any potential trash piles. I will need to descend to a lower altitude to search for the object. I should also be aware of my surroundings and stay within the bounds of the search area (400x400 meters) and the limits of my movement (9 moves, max altitude of 120 meters).
</Reasoning>
