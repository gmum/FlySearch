<Reasoning> I have descended to 21 meters and I can see several points marked with altitudes close to or below 10 meters. However, none of these points are directly below 10 meters, so I will continue my search slightly to the north to cover a larger area. I will also keep an eye on the altitudes to ensure I don't accidentally fly too close to anything.
