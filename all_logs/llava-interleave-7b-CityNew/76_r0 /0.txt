<Reasoning> Flying at 69 meters, I'm looking for a change in the terrain below that would indicate a road construction site. I'm heading towards the center of the grid, staying below 10 meters at all times to ensure accuracy. I'll be checking the lower part of the image, close to the center to find the object. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I've descended to a lower altitude and found a cluster of points that seem to be the object. I'm now flying slightly north to get a better view and to align with the object to confirm it's the one. The altitude remains below 10 meters. </Reasoning>

<Found> Found the object below 10 meters. The altitude is central and I'm directly above the point in question. I'll check the surrounding area to ensure there are no other constructions nearby. </Found>
