<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 80 meters is not optimal for finding a trash pile. I will adjust my altitude to below 10 meters to search for the object and then fly it down to the object to check if it's the one. I will also carefully navigate to avoid any obstacles or being too close to other objects.</ Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have flown down to an altitude of 10 meters below the object in question. Now, I will fly it closer to be sure it's the one. I will carefully search the area to ensure there's no other large trash pile nearby.</ Reasoning>
