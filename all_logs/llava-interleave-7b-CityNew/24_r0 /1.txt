<Reasoning> I have descended to a height of 10 meters below the center point of the object (x, y) and I am now flying to a lower altitude to ensure I am centered on the object. I will check the object's position in the next image. I have descended to an altitude of 9 meters and I am now centered on the object. I will fly slightly to the north to check for any other objects or to continue the search. </Reasoning>
