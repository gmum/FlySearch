<Reasoning>I have flown slightly to the north to get a better view and to ensure I am centered on the object. I am now below 10 meters relative to the object at (10, 10). I will continue my search in this area, keeping an eye on the yellow points, as they seem to be the most likely to be the object.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>This is an aerial view of the area. I will continue to search for the object by flying slightly to the east to get a better view and to ensure I am centered on the object. I will keep an eye on the yellow points, which seem to be the most likely to be the object based on their proximity to the center of the grid.</Reasoning>
