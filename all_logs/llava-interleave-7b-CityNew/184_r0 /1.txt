<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 4 meters, I have identified the point (63, 31, 0) on the grid that appears to be close to the water's edge, which could potentially be the construction site. I am now descending to a height of 10 meters below this point to perform a closer inspection. If this is the object, I will continue my search below 10 meters. If not, I will reevaluate my search parameters.</Reasoning>
