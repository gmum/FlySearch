<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 39 meters above ground level is not optimal for this search. I will fly below 10 meters and then adjust my position to be closer to the object. I will also check the yellow points on the grid to see if any are below 10 meters in height.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have descended to an altitude just above 10 meters and I am now checking the yellow points on the grid for any that are closer to or below 10 meters in height. I have found a point (13, 13) on the grid that is below 10 meters in height. This is likely the object I'm looking for.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have found the object at (13, 13) on the grid and I am now flying below 10 meters relative to it. I will reply with "FOUND" as I am within the required altitude limit.</Reasoning>
