<Reasoning>Upon further investigation, I have found a potential object of interest near the point marked (30, 30) on the grid. However, to confirm, I must fly closer and lower to the object to ensure it is the correct one and not merely a point of interest in close proximity. I will fly to a lower altitude, staying within the search area and close to the object, to have a proper check.</Reasoning>
