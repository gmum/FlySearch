<Reasoning>Based on the provided coordinates and the grid overlay, the object of interest is likely in the vicinity of the yellow points marked (30, 20) and (30, 30). To investigate, I will fly to a lower altitude, staying within the search area (400x400m from the starting position) and close to the object (10 meters or below) to ensure a proper search.</Reasoning>
