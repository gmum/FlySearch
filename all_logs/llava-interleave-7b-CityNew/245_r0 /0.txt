<Reasoning> I have arrived at the area around the (-61, 62) coordinate on the grid. I will move in this direction to search for the object. I am flying below 10 meters to get a better view and to be closer to the potential object.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have found an object at (-31, 61) that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment. It's closer to the ground and doesn't match the pattern of the surrounding buildings and streets. This is the anomaly I was looking for.</Reasoning>
