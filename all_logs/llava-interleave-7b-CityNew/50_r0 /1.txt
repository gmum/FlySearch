<Reasoning> I have flown to an altitude of 64 meters and I am now approaching the object with coordinates (0, 0, -10) below 10 meters. I will continue the search in this area if the object isn't found at this altitude. If it is found, I will fly below 10 meters to ensure the object is within my field of view and I am centered on it.</Reasoning>
