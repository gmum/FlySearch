<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 88 meters is not ideal for a search, especially when trying to get close to an object. I will descend to a lower altitude to search for the object. Flying just below 10 meters should provide a good starting point for the search. I will move to the coordinates (5, 0, -30) to get closer to the object.</Reasoning>
