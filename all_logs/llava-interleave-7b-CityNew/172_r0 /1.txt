<Reasoning> The drone is currently at an altitude of 58 meters, and there's still a significant height gap between the drone and the potential object. I will descend to a lower altitude to search for the object. Flying just below 10 meters should provide a good starting point for the search. I will move to the coordinates (5, 0, -30) to get closer to the object.</Reasoning>
