<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 24 meters, I have checked the points on the grid and I have identified a potential object of interest at (11, 11). To get a better view of this point and to check if it's the object, I will fly down to an altitude of 10 meters below it, which would bring me to an altitude of 14 from the ground.</Reasoning>
行动计划：(11, 11, -10)
