<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 34 meters, I have checked the points on the grid and I have identified a potential object of interest at (23, 23). To get a better view of this point and to check if it's the object, I will fly down to a altitude of 10 meters below it, which would bring me to an altitude of 4 from the ground.</Reasoning>
