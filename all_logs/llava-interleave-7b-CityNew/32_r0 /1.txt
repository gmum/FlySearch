<Reasoning> I have flown closer to the object at the point (5, 0, -30). However, based on the updated coordinates, it seems that the object is at a slightly different point on the grid, closer to the north. I will adjust my position to (7, 0, -30) to get even closer and check if this is the correct object.</Reasoning>
