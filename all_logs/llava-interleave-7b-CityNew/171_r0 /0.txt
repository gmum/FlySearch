<Reasoning> Based on the overlaid grid and the coordinates provided, I'm looking at a point (x, y) which appears to be close to the water's edge and slightly above the water level. I need to descend to a lower altitude to continue my search. I will move slightly to the north to clear the water's edge and then descend to a lower altitude to get closer to the object.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have descended to a lower altitude and I'm now flying slightly to the north to align with the object's coordinates. I am within 10 meters above the object based on the provided coordinates and I can see the object in my field of view.</Reasoning>
