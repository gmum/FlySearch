<Reasoning>Based on the grid coordinates and the current altitude of the drone, it appears that the object of interest might be near the point (-44, -45, 0). I need to fly lower to check if this is the object. Flying below 10 meters would be ideal, but I'll allow a slight margin of error.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>After flying below 10 meters, I have checked the point (-44, -45, 0) and it appears to be the object. I am now below 10 meters relative to the object.</Found>
