<Reasoning> I have checked the points at a lower altitude (around -10 meters) and there doesn't seem to be an object at that level. However, considering the points slightly above (-1, -10) and to the north (+1, -10), I might have found the object. I'll fly below 10 meters to confirm and then reply with "FOUND" if I am centered on the object or continue searching if not.</Reasoning>
