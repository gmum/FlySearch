<Reasoning> Flying at my current altitude above the object set at 57 meters might not yield enough time or precision to determine with certainty whether the object is at 10 meters or lower. I will search a smaller grid to increase my chances of finding the object close to the object at 10 meters or lower.</Reasoning>
