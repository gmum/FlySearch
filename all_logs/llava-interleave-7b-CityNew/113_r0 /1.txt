<Reasoning> I have revised my trajectory to maintain a safer altitude while searching for the object.

I will continue my search within this smaller grid.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have found the object, and it appears to be at a height of approximately 10 meters or lower. I am now in a position to confirm whether it is indeed the object.</Reasoning>
