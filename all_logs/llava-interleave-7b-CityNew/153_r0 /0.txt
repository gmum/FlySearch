<Reasoning>Given the current altitude and the search area, I will start my search below the drone's current altitude and to the north to cover more ground and to be in a better position to find the object. I will search in a grid that covers the area from the drone's current position to the north and slightly to the east to avoid going outside the search area.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Continuing the search, I am now below 50 meters and will proceed to the north to cover more ground. I will keep an eye on the yellow points to see if any are the object.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I have found a yellow point that is within my search area and is below 10 meters from the drone. This is the object I've been looking for.</Reasoning>
