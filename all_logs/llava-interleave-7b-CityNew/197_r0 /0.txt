<Reasoning> Flying at 33 meters, I see several points near the altitude of 10 meters below the drone. However, none of them appear to be the object in question. I will slightly adjust my position and continue the search. Flying to the left and lower to improve my visibility and proximity to the object.</Reasoning>
