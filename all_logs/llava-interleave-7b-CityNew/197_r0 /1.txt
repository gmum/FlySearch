<Reasoning> Flying at 23 meters, I have found a large group of points that appear to be the object, which is a trash pile. The points are clustered together and seem to be at a lower altitude in comparison to the surrounding area. I am now flying below 10 meters relative to the object to confirm its identity. If this is the object, I will continue my search for any additional confirmation or context. If not, I will continue the search for the actual object.</Reasoning>
