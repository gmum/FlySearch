<Reasoning>Upon further examination of the image and the grid coordinates, it appears that the object of interest might be around the point (27, 27) on the grid. To get below 10 meters, I need to move slightly to the south (y-axis) and go down (x-axis). However, I should also be mindful of remaining within my field of view and not going outside the search area of 400x400m from the drone's starting position.</Reasoning>
