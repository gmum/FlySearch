<Reasoning> I have adjusted my altitude to 73 meters, which is lower than the starting altitude. However, there's still a significant altitude gap between my current position and potential object locations. I will search for the object while maintaining a lower altitude, below 10 meters relative to the object when found. Remember, I must be within my field of view and below 10 meters when replying with "FOUND". I will also take into account the grid lines to move with precision.</Reasoning>
