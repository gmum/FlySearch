<Reasoning> Since I've already found the anomaly and I'm now just above 10 meters relative to it, I'll stay centered on the anomaly and search for any other possible anomalies in the vicinity. I'll continue to fly slightly above and below 10 meters to make sure I cover the entire area. I'll also be cautious not to get too close to the already found anomaly to avoid any potential issues.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I've checked the area around the anomaly and I couldn't find any other anomalies within this search area. Since I've confirmed the anomaly I started with and I'm still within the bounds of my search area, I'll conclude that I've found all the anomalies for this image.</Reasoning>

<Found> True </Found>
