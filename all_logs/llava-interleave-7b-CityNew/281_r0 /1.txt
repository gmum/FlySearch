<Reasoning>As I am still unable to identify the anomaly, I will continue my search below 10 meters and to the north. I will also closely examine the areas with the (-41,-40) and (-41,40) coordinates, as these may be the object of interest given my current perspective.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>This area seems to be the anomaly. I have found an object that does not fit in with the rest of the environment. Flying below 10 meters and centered on this point will allow me to confirm if this is the anomaly.</Action>(-41, -41, -10)</


<Reasoning>This is the object of interest. I have flown below 10 meters and centered on it. Based on my current position, I am within 10 meters of the object. I will now confirm if this is the anomaly.</Action>(-41, -41, -10)</
