<Reasoning>This is an aerial view of the intersection. I have identified several points that seem out of place relative to the surroundings. Let's start by flying lower to investigate these points. I will search for an anomaly below 10 meters above the drone.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>After flying below 10 meters, I have located an anomaly at the grid point (18, 18). Flying closer to this point (approximately at 5 to 8 meters below the drone) should provide a better view to confirm if this is the anomaly.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Upon closer inspection, I have determined that the point at (18, 18) is the anomaly. Flying below 10 meters and to the center of this anomaly confirms the object of interest.</Reasoning>

<Found>Found the anomaly at (18, 18) below 10 meters.</Found>
