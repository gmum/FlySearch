<Reasoning>Based on the available points and the current altitude of the drone, I have determined the following plan of action. I will search for the red car by flying below 10 meters and then adjust my course as necessary to stay within the search area and the bounds of the drone's capabilities.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, -10, -10)</Action>
<Reasoning> flying slightly lower and to the left to search for the red car closer to the edge of the search area. Flying slightly higher to maintain access to the search area.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, -5, -5)</Action>
<Reasoning>Continuing to fly lower while still staying within the search area and the bounds of the drone's capabilities.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>
<Reasoning>Having arrived at a lower altitude and centered on the red car, I will now fly just above 10 meters to confirm the object's identity.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, 0)</Action>
<Found>Found the red car at 0 meters below the drone.</Found>
