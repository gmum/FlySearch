<Reasoning> I have arrived at the yellow points and I see one that is below 10 meters. I'll fly to that point and check if it's the anomaly.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> The object is at or near the point (24, 0). It's below 10 meters and within my field of view. I'll fly below 10 meters and report "FOUND".</Reasoning>
