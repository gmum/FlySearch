<Reasoning> At an altitude of 27 meters, I am still unable to clearly see the ground or surfaces below. I need to adjust my altitude to a lower value to improve my field of view and search for the object. Flying below 10 meters relative to the object is crucial for a successful search. I will attempt to fly below this altitude while remaining within the search area and the limitations provided.</Reasoning>
