<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 63 meters above ground level may not provide a clear view of the ground or surfaces below. I will adjust my altitude to a lower value to improve my field of view and search for the object. Flying below 10 meters relative to the object is crucial for a successful search. I will attempt to fly below this altitude while remaining within the search area and the limitations provided.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have flown below 10 meters relative to the object and it appears to be the yellow point we've been looking for. I am now in a suitable position to confirm the object as the one we're seeking.</Reasoning>
