<Reasoning> Upon flying closer and scanning the area, I've found a point that is closer to the ground and within 10 meters of the drone. This point has a lower altitude than the others, which makes it the most likely to be the object I'm looking for. I will fly slightly lower to get a better view and confirm the object's identity.</Reasoning>
