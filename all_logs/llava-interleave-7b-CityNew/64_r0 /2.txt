<Reasoning> Flying closer to the point I identified, I can confirm that this is the object. I am now flying just below 10 meters above it and can report "FOUND". The object is in my field of view and I am centered on it.</Reasoning>
<Found> Found the object at an altitude of approximately 10 meters below the drone.</Found>
