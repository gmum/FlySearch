<Reasoning> From my current altitude of 78 meters, I have identified a point (5, 5) on the grid that is lower than 10 meters below the drone. However, a more thorough search is necessary to ensure the point is the object of interest and not just a coincidence. I will fly down to an altitude of 10 meters below the drone and then continue my search. Please wait a moment. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I have flown below 10 meters and found an object at (5, 5) on the grid. This is lower than 10 meters and is in my field of view. I will now fly slightly to the south to confirm that this is the object.</Reasoning>
