<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 53 meters above ground level does not provide a clear view of the ground or object in question. I will need to descend to a lower altitude to perform a thorough search. Flying below 10 meters relative to the object in question is crucial for a successful search. I will also need to adjust my position slightly to the north to ensure I am centered on the object and at a lower altitude.</Reasoning>
