<Reasoning> I have descended to a lower altitude and am now centered on the object in question. However, there may be other objects or obstructions nearby that I need to be aware of when I reply with "FOUND". I will fly just below 10 meters to ensure that I have found the correct object and am prepared to adjust my position if necessary.</Reasoning>
