<Reasoning> I have flown below 10 meters and I am now centered on a potential object. However, I must carefully evaluate the surrounding points to ensure the object is the one at the center. I will continue my search, staying below 10 meters and slightly to the north to cover a larger area while staying within the search bounds and drone's field of view.</Reasoning>
