<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates and the drone's current altitude, it appears we have to move below the drone's current altitude of 36 meters to search for the object. Flying below 10 meters will give us the best chance of being close to the object. I will proceed with a move below 10 meters in the center of the image.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>After moving below 10 meters, I am now centered with the object (indicated by the yellow point). I will fly below 10 meters to ensure we are close enough to the object to report our finding.</Reasoning>
