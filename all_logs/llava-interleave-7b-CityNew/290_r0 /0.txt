<Reasoning> Flying at a lower altitude, I have identified a potential object of interest. I will proceed to lower myself to a maximum of 10 meters below the object to confirm its identity. If this turns out to be the correct object, I will then fly just above it to a minimum of 10 meters before confirming that it has been found.</Reasoning>
