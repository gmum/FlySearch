<Reasoning> Flying at 46 meters above the object may not be the best approach. I should search a lower altitude to better evaluate the situation. Flying below 10 meters relative to the object would be ideal. I will search an area below 10 meters and if I don't find the object within this vicinity, I will adjust my altitude and search area.</Reasoning>
