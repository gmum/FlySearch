<Reasoning>This image shows a grid overlay with a variety of marked points, altitudes, and coordinates. I have flown below 10 meters and I'm now searching for the anomaly. I will continue to adjust the altitude and direction as needed to get closer to the object. I will also look to the north to ensure I haven't missed the object to the south.</Reasoning>
