<Reasoning>This image shows a grid overlay, and there are several marked points with coordinates and altitudes. To find the anomaly, I need to search below 10 meters in height and potentially adjust the altitude and direction to get closer to the object. I will start by flying below 10 meters and then make adjustments as needed.</Reasoning>
