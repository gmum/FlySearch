<Reasoning>By flying closer to the ground and checking the relative positions of the points, I've found an anomaly at (-18, -9, 0). This point is lower than the others and doesn't seem to be matched by any other point in the grid. Flying there and staying below 10 meters should confirm if this is the object.</Reasoning>
