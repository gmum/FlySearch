<Reasoning> It seems I have encountered an obstacle while approaching the anomaly. I am retracting to a higher altitude to avoid any collision and continue the search.</Reasoning>

Action: (-5, 0, 20)

<Reasoning> I have raised my altitude and am now resuming the search. I will continue flying below 10 meters to find the anomaly.</Reasoning>

Action: (32, 0, -10)

<Reasoning> I have found the anomaly at approximately (32, 0) on the grid. I am now flying below 10 meters to confirm if this is the object of interest.</Reasoning>

Action: (32, 0, -10)
