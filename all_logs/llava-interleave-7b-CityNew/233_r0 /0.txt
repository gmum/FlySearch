<Reasoning>This is an aerial view of the area. I have identified several points that may be considered anomalies based on their coordinates. I will start by flying below 10 meters and then proceed to the areas where the points might be to check if they could be the object of interest.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> flying below 10 meters now

I have checked the areas where the points might be and I have found an object that meets the criteria. It is located at approximately (32, 0) on the grid. I am now flying to it to confirm if this is the anomaly.</Reasoning>
