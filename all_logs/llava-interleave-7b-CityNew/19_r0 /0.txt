<Reasoning>This search area is quite large, and without any constraints on altitude or field of view, it would take a significant amount of time to search through all these coordinates. I will start by flying lower to the nearest 10-meter-marked points and check if any of them are the object. If not, I will continue the search in a more northerly direction.</Reasoning>
