<Reasoning>Given the available coordinates and the drone's current altitude above ground level of 82 meters, I will fly below 10 meters and search for the object. I have found a point (x, y, z) that is below 10 meters and within the search area. Flying to this point will likely be the object of interest.</Reasoning>
