<Reasoning>Based on the overlaid grid and the coordinates provided, I have identified a potential object of interest at (10, 10). To ensure I am below 10 meters and centered on the object, I will move in the following manner: <Action>(10, 10, -10)</Action>. This will bring me below 10 meters and centered on the object.</Reasoning>
