<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates and the grid overlay, I believe the blue sport car is located around the area denoted by the point (12, 24) on the grid. To search for the object, I will move the drone to a lower altitude while staying within the search area and close to that point (12, 24) on the grid.</Reasoning>
