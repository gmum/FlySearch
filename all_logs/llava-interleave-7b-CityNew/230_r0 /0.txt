<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the search area limited to 400x400m from the drone's starting position, I have identified a point that appears to be significantly lower than the rest and might be the object of interest. I will descend to a minimum of 10 meters below this point to continue the search. If this is not the object, I will adjust my position and continue the search.</Reasoning>
