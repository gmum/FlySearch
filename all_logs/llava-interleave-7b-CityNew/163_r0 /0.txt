<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 75 meters above ground level is not ideal for this task. I need to fly closer to the ground to search for the object. Flying below 10 meters and staying within the search area of 400x400 meters should provide a good starting point. I will also adjust my position slightly to the north to cover more ground and ensure I am centered on the object if it's not the one I'm currently looking at.</Reasoning>
