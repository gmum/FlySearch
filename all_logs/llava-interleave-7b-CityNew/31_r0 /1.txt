<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 8 meters, I have identified several points that are lower than 10 meters. I have found a point that is below 10 meters, and I will fly to that location to investigate if it is the object in question.

I will fly to the point that is at a lower altitude.

ACTION (5, 0, -10)
