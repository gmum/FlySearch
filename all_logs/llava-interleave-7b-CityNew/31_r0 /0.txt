<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 58 meters, I have identified several points that are lower than 10 meters. However, none of these points are directly below 10 meters, so I will proceed with a more thorough search to ensure I find the object.

I will start by flying slightly to the north to clear any obstacles and then descend to a lower altitude to search for the object.
