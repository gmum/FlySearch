<Reasoning> Flying at 52 meters, I have a few options to search for the object. I will move slightly to the east to enter a more confined search area, and then descend to a lower altitude to get closer to the ground. I will search below 10 meters and to the north to cover the most ground and be within the bounds of the search area.</Reasoning>
