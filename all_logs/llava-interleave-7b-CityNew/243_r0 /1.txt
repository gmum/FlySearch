<Reasoning>Based on the coordinates provided and the search area given, I am currently at an altitude of 90 meters above ground level. I will fly down to the nearest 10-meter mark on the grid, which corresponds to an altitude of 80 meters. I will then proceed to the northeast to cover the remaining search area.</Reasoning>
