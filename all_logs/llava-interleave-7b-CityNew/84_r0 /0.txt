<Reasoning> Flying at 93 meters above, I'm checking the vicinity for the construction site. I'm approaching a point (x, y) on the grid, checking for any potential construction site that would be within 10 meters from the drone's center of vision when flying below 10 meters.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> I've flown below 10 meters and I found a point (x, y) on the grid that seems to be the construction site. I'm now flying to that point to confirm. Flying slightly to the north to maintain a centered approach.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning> Centered on the object, I'm checking the altitude to ensure I'm below 10 meters. It appears so.</Reasoning>
