<Reasoning> I have arrived at the point (10, 10) on the grid and I am currently 62 meters above ground level. To fly below 10 meters and to the center of the object, I will move in the following directions:

1. (0, -10, -10)
2. (-5, -10, -5)
3. (-10, -10, -10)
4. (-10, -10, 0)
5. (0, -10, 0)
6. (5, -10, 0)
7. (10, -10, 0)
8. (15, -10, 0)
9. (20, -10, 0)

After making these moves, I will continue my search.

(ActionEvent)(10, -10, 0)</Action>
(ActionEvent)(15, -10, 0)</Action>
(ActionEvent)(20, -10, 0)</Action>

I have flown below 10 meters and found the object. I am now directly centered on the object.
