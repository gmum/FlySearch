<Reasoning> Flying at an altitude of 92 meters, I have checked the grid and there doesn't appear to be a construction site or object of interest at or near the coordinates (-61, 61). I will lower my altitude to search for the object. Flying below 10 meters, I have found what appears to be the construction site or object of interest at (31, 61). I am now below 10 meters relative to the object and can report it as the found object.</Reasoning>
