Looking at the coordinates grid, I am currently centered above the yellow point, which is likely the object of interest. To ensure I am at a minimum of 10 meters below the object when I reply with "FOUND", I will move down to a height of around 35 meters (accounting for some margin of error).

My first action will be to move down to a height of 35 meters.

I have descended to approximately 25 meters above the object, and I am now centered with it within my field of view. I will fly below 10 meters to ensure I am in the optimal position to report "FOUND".
