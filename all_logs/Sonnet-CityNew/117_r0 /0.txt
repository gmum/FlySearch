<Reasoning>I need to systematically search for a crowd in this urban environment. From my current altitude of 97 meters, I can see a large area but need to get lower to better identify any gatherings. The image shows buildings and a highway, with potential spaces between buildings where crowds might gather. I'll move towards (-65, 32) as this area shows some open space between buildings, and I'll descend to get a better view.</Reasoning>
