<Reasoning>I apologize for the unsafe movement. We've reached our maximum number of allowed moves (9) and haven't successfully completed the mission. We should have been more systematic in our search pattern and better at maintaining safe distances from obstacles. The mission will need to be restarted with a better search strategy that includes maintaining safer distances from buildings and structures while systematically covering the search area.</Reasoning>
