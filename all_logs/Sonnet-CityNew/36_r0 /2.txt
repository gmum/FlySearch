<Reasoning>I'm now at a good height to spot crowds, but I need to continue my search. I notice:
1. The southern area I moved to doesn't show any crowds
2. I should check the northern area as it's not fully visible from my current position
3. While maintaining this workable altitude, I'll move north to continue the search

I'll move north to explore that section of the intersection.</Reasoning>
