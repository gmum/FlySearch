<Reasoning>I can see an intersection from a high vantage point. Since I'm looking for a crowd and don't see any obvious gatherings from this height, I should:
1. Move lower to get a better view
2. Stay near the center intersection as it's a likely gathering point
3. Maintain a position that allows me to scan in all directions

I'll descend to 30 meters while staying near the center to get a better view of the street level.</Reasoning>
