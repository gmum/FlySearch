<Reasoning>At this lower altitude, I can see more detail of the street level, but:
1. Still no sign of any crowds
2. I've now systematically searched the intersection from multiple angles and heights
3. I may need to expand my search radius to find the crowd

Since I've nearly used all my allowed moves and haven't found the crowd in the immediate intersection area, I should make one final check of the southern area at this lower altitude.</Reasoning>
