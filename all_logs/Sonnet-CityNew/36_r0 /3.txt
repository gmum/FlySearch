<Reasoning>I need to continue my systematic search. From this position:
1. I still don't see any crowds in this northern section
2. I haven't checked the eastern side of the intersection yet
3. This height is good for spotting crowds, so I'll maintain it

I'll move east to explore that section while maintaining my current altitude.</Reasoning>
