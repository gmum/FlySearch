<Reasoning>I'm now on the western side of the intersection. I can see:
1. No crowds visible in this section either
2. I've now checked all four main directions from the intersection
3. I should descend further to get a closer look at street level, as I might be missing something from this height

I'll maintain my current position but descend to get a closer view of the street.</Reasoning>
