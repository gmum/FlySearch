<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see the intersection more clearly, but still no clear sign of a crowd. I should:
1. Continue descending to get an even better view of street level
2. Move slightly south as there appears to be more open space in that direction
3. Get closer to about 15 meters to have a better view while maintaining enough height to scan the area

I'll move south and continue descending to better observe any potential gatherings.</Reasoning>
