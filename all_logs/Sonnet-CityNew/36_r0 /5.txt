<Reasoning>I see I'm in a covered area with a low ceiling. For safety:
1. I need to descend to get away from the ceiling structure
2. I should maintain my current horizontal position until I'm at a safer height
3. A height of about 5 meters would give me enough clearance from both ground and ceiling

I'll descend in place to achieve safer clearance from obstacles.</Reasoning>
