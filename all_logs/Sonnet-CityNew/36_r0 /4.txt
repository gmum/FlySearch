<Reasoning>I apologize for the unsafe move. I notice I'm too close to the ceiling structure. I should:
1. Move back to a safer position
2. Continue my search but with more attention to obstacles
3. Consider checking the western side of the intersection since I haven't explored there yet

I'll move west to a safer position while maintaining my current altitude.</Reasoning>
