<Reasoning>Now I'm back in a safer position. I still need to search for the crowd. I notice:
1. I've checked north (which had a covered structure)
2. I haven't thoroughly checked the western side yet
3. I should maintain this safer altitude while moving west

I'll move west to continue my search pattern.</Reasoning>
