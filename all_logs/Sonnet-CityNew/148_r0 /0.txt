<Reasoning>
From this aerial view at 52 meters, I can see an urban environment with buildings and streets, but I don't immediately spot a large trash pile. I should systematically search the area by first moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of potential locations. I'll move towards the center coordinates (0, 0) and reduce altitude by 20 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue the search effectively.
