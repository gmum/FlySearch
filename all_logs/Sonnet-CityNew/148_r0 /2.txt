I need to be more careful with my altitude changes. I can see what appears to be some irregular patterns or debris in the lower left portion of the image, near coordinates (-14, -27). I'll move in that direction while making a smaller altitude adjustment of -10 meters to get a closer look while maintaining safe clearance.
