From this new view at 41 meters, I can see what appears to be an open area with some darker patches that could potentially be trash piles. I notice some irregular patterns in the lower portion of the image. I'll move towards (0, -27) to investigate that area while lowering my altitude by 15 meters to get a better view of what's down there.
