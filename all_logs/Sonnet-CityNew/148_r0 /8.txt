Now I have a much clearer view and I can see I was actually inside or very close to a building structure before. From this higher vantage point at 61 meters, I can see the urban layout more clearly. I should look for open areas or industrial zones where a trash pile might be located. I can see what appears to be some industrial or storage area towards (20, -41). I'll move in that direction while maintaining this safer altitude.
