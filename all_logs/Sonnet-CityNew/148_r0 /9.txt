<Reasoning>
From this new position, I can see what appears to be railway tracks and industrial areas. I've used 9 moves already, which is my limit according to the controls. Looking back at the objective, I haven't been successful in finding and getting close to (below 10 meters) of a large trash pile. It seems I may have missed something or taken the wrong approach in my search strategy, particularly by spending too many moves dealing with being too close to a building initially.
