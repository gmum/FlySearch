<Reasoning>From this aerial view at 94 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. I'll start by moving to the center of the visible area (0,0) and reducing altitude significantly to get a better view of potential targets. This will give me a better vantage point to spot any large accumulations of debris or trash.</Reasoning>
