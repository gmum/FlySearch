The urban environment with tall buildings has made it challenging to safely descend to the required altitude of less than 10 meters while maintaining a clear view of potential targets. A different search strategy might have been needed from the beginning, perhaps starting with a wider area scan at a moderate altitude to identify promising areas before attempting closer inspection.</Reasoning>
