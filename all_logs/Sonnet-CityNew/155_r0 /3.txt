FOUND

<Reasoning>I am now perfectly positioned over what appears to be a pile of debris that shows signs of fire/burning. I am at 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and the target is centered in my field of view. This meets all mission requirements - below 10m altitude, centered on the target, and the target is clearly visible.</Reasoning>
