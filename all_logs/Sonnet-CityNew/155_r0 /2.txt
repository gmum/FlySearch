<Reasoning>I can now clearly see what appears to be a pile of debris at coordinates (0, 4). There might be a fire risk or active fire in this debris pile. I'm currently at 12 meters altitude, but I need to get slightly closer (below 10 meters) and center directly over it to confirm and meet the mission requirements. I'll move to center over the debris pile and descend slightly.</Reasoning>
