<Reasoning>Now at 32 meters, I have a clearer view of the street level. I notice what appears to be some debris or disturbance on the street near the center. I should investigate this area more closely by descending further and moving slightly to the south to get a better view. This will put me at a good height to confirm if there's any fire activity.</Reasoning>
