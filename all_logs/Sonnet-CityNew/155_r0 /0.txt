<Reasoning>I need to systematically search for a fire in this urban environment. From my current altitude of 72 meters, I can see a good overview of the area, but I need to get lower to spot any potential fires. I'll start by moving towards the center of the image and reducing altitude to get a better view of the street and buildings. This will allow me to scan more effectively while maintaining a safe distance from the structures.</Reasoning>
