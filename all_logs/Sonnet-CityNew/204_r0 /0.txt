<Reasoning>I can see an urban environment with roads, buildings, and some vehicles. I need to conduct a systematic search to find any anomalies. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. Moving to coordinates (0,0) and descending by 35 meters to be at 30 meters altitude, which will give me a clearer view while maintaining safe operations.</Reasoning>
