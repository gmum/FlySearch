<Reasoning>I need to perform a systematic search for the trash pile. From this height and view, I don't immediately see the target, but I should start by moving to a position that gives me a better view of the area and reducing altitude to see more detail. I'll move towards the center of the visible area and descend 30 meters to get a better look.</Reasoning>
