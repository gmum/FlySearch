<Reasoning>I can now see a blue car clearly, but I need to ensure I maintain a safe distance while confirming if it's the sports car I'm looking for. From my current position and altitude, I have a good view of what appears to be a blue vehicle. I'll stay at this position since I'm already at a good height (8 meters) and can see the target clearly.</Reasoning>
