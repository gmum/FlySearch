<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be road construction or repair work on the street below. The area shows some lighter colored patches on the road surface that could indicate construction activity. Since I need to get closer to confirm and need to be below 10 meters when reporting, I'll move closer to the center of this area and significantly reduce altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
