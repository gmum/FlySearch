<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the road construction site - the surface shows clear signs of recent work with rough asphalt texture. I am already at a good altitude (8 meters) and have the construction site in my field of view, centered in the image. This position meets all the requirements: below 10 meters altitude, centered on the target, and with clear visibility of the construction site.</Reasoning>
