<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an intersection and highways from a high altitude. I notice there might be something unusual near the (-30, -30) coordinates - I can see what looks like a light-colored circular object that seems out of place on the dark surface. I'll move closer to that area and reduce altitude to get a better look.</Reasoning>
