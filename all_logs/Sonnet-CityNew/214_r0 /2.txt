FOUND

<Reasoning>I am now centered above the silver/metallic circular object that appears to be some kind of manhole cover or similar metallic disc on the road surface. My altitude is 9 meters, which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view. This metallic circular object definitely stands out as an anomaly against the dark asphalt road surface.</Reasoning>
