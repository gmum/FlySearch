<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a trash pile or construction debris in the yellow marked area around coordinates (-16, -33). I need to move closer to that location and significantly reduce altitude to get below 10 meters to confirm if this is the target. I'll move to those coordinates and descend by 40 meters to get a better view.</Reasoning>
