<Reasoning>From this lower altitude (29m), I can see more detail but still no clear signs of fire. I'll move towards the eastern side of the street (10, 0) where there's better visibility and continue descending to get an even closer look. I'll drop another 15 meters to get a better view while staying at a safe height.</Reasoning>
