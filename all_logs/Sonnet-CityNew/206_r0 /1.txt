FOUND

The anomalous blue circular object is clearly visible in my field of view, and I am now positioned at 8 meters above it, which meets the requirement of being below 10 meters. The object appears to be some kind of unusual marking or object on the road surface that doesn't match the normal road markings and infrastructure.
