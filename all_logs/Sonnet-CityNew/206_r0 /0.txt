<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a blue-ish circular object near coordinates (16, -10). This could be the anomaly I'm looking for as it stands out from the regular road and crosswalk patterns. I'll move closer to that position and reduce altitude significantly to get a better view and position myself below 10 meters.</Reasoning>
