From this aerial view at 87 meters, I can see a highway intersection and several vehicles. I need to systematically search the area for a black truck. I'll start by moving to the southeastern quadrant (29, -29) and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the vehicles in that area. This will allow me to inspect the vehicles in the parking lots and roads more clearly while maintaining a safe operating height.
