I can see what appears to be a parking lot with several vehicles. Given my task to find an anomaly, I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. I notice a red vehicle that stands out in the lower left portion of the image around coordinates (23, -12). I'll move closer to that area and lower my altitude to get a better view while staying centered on that region.
