I can see what appears to be a gray metallic structure or container that looks out of place among the other objects in the area. It's positioned near the center of the image around coordinates (0, 0). Since I'm already at 9 meters altitude, which is below our 10-meter requirement, and I'm centered on what appears to be the anomalous object, I can declare that I've found it.
