<Reasoning>At this lower altitude of 10 meters, I can see what appears to be a blue object near coordinates (0, 7). This could be our anomaly as it stands out against the grey pavement and standard road markings. I'll move closer to it while maintaining my current altitude since I'm already below 10 meters.</Reasoning>
