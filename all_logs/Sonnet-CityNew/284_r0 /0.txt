<Reasoning>From this aerial view at 60 meters, I can see an urban environment with buildings and streets. I notice something that looks like a yellow object near the coordinates (0, -40). To investigate this potential anomaly better, I'll move closer to that area and reduce altitude to get a better view. I'll position myself directly above it while descending to 30 meters.</Reasoning>
