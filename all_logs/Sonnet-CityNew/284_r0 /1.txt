<Reasoning>I can now see a crosswalk intersection more clearly. I can see a yellow taxi near the coordinates (-20, 20), but that's likely not our anomaly as taxis are common in urban environments. I notice some yellow road markings, but these are also normal for a crosswalk. Let me scan the southern part of this view and descend further to get a better look at any potential anomalies.</Reasoning>
