<Reasoning>I've successfully moved to a safer position and descended a bit. I can still see the crowd near (-13, 0). From this vantage point over the street, I should be able to make a final descent to get below 10 meters while keeping the crowd in view. I'll move to (-13, 0) and descend just enough to get under 10 meters.</Reasoning>
