<Reasoning>I need to systematically search for a large trash pile in this urban environment. From this height and initial position, I can see several streets and buildings. I should first descend to get a better view of the street level where trash would likely be located. I'll maintain my current x,y position but reduce altitude significantly to get a clearer view of what's below.</Reasoning>
