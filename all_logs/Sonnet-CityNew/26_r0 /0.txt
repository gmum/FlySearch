<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a road construction site in the middle-right portion of the image, with some exposed foundation or road work visible. To get a better view and meet the requirement of being below 10 meters, I'll move towards the construction site and significantly decrease altitude. I'll position myself at (14, 0) to center over the construction area and drop down 35 meters, which will put me at approximately 8 meters above ground level.</Reasoning>
