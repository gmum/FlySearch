I can now clearly see a small aircraft parked on the street, which is definitely the anomaly we're looking for. I'm currently at 26 meters altitude, but I need to get closer - below 10 meters - while staying centered above it. I'll descend 20 more meters to get to approximately 6 meters above the aircraft while maintaining my position over it.
