FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly positioned above the small aircraft at 6 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters. The aircraft is clearly visible in my field of view and I am centered above it. This satisfies all the requirements: the object is in view, I am below 10 meters altitude, and I am centered on the anomaly.
