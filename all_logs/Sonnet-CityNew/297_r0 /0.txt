From this high altitude, I can see an urban intersection with buildings and streets. To effectively search for anomalies, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while maintaining a position that gives me good visibility of the area. I'll move to the center position and decrease altitude by 40 meters to get a clearer view of the intersection and surrounding area.
