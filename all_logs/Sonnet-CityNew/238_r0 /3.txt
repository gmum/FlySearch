FOUND

<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the anomaly - there's a yellow pole or post near the crosswalk that appears to be out of place in this environment. I am currently at 9 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view. The drone is also well-positioned relative to the object.</Reasoning>
