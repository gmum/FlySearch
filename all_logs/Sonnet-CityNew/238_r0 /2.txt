<Reasoning>At 21m, I can now see the ground much more clearly. I notice several parked vehicles in the upper portion of the image that appear to be covered in what looks like white covers. However, there's something that catches my attention - I can see what appears to be a yellow pole or post near the intersection with the crosswalk markings. This could be our anomaly. I'll move closer to that area and lower the altitude further to confirm.</Reasoning>
