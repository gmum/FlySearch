<Reasoning>I need to perform a systematic search for any anomalies in the urban environment. From this high altitude (91m), I can see multiple buildings, streets, and intersections, but I need to get lower to spot any potential anomalies. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view of the area.</Reasoning>
