<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a white circular object near the center of the image that seems out of place on the dark road surface. I'll move closer to investigate it by descending to get a better view while maintaining its position in my field of view. Since I need to be below 10 meters to confirm the find, I'll descend by 25 meters, which will put me at 9 meters altitude - safely below the 10-meter requirement.</Reasoning>
