<Reasoning>
From this aerial view at 43 meters, I can see a street with some buildings and parking areas, but I don't see any clear crowds yet. I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while staying roughly in the center area. I'll move to coordinate (0,0) which is in the middle of the visible area and decrease altitude by 20 meters to get a clearer view of the street level.</Reasoning>
