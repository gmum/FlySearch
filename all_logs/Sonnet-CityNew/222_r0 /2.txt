<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a red vehicle that appears to be different from the typical traffic pattern. At 20 meters altitude, I'm getting closer but need to be under 10 meters to properly confirm this as the anomaly. I'll maintain the same position but descend another 11 meters to get to 9 meters altitude, which will put me below the required 10-meter threshold while keeping the object in view.</Reasoning>
