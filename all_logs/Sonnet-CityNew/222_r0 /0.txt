<Reasoning>I need to start searching systematically for any anomalies. From this height and angle, I can see a major road with some vehicles and buildings. I'll first move to a central position and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area. Moving to coordinates (0, 0) and descending by 25 meters seems like a good first move to get a better overview while maintaining enough height to spot potential anomalies.</Reasoning>
