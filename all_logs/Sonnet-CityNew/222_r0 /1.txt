<Reasoning>From this new position and lower altitude, I can see the area more clearly. I notice something that might be unusual near coordinates (0, -17) - there appears to be a red object that seems different from the typical vehicles and structures. I'll move to that position and lower my altitude further to investigate this potential anomaly more closely.</Reasoning>
