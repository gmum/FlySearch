<Reasoning>I notice that my previous attempts to descend have resulted in emergency stops, which suggests there might be obstacles or safety concerns at lower altitudes in this urban environment. Given that I can clearly see the fire from my current position and going lower might be unsafe, I should maintain this position as it allows me to monitor the fire while staying at a safe altitude.</Reasoning>
