<Reasoning>I can see several vehicles from this aerial view, but I need to search systematically for a black truck. I notice some vehicles in the lower part of the image, particularly around the coordinates (0,-18). I'll move closer to that area and reduce altitude to get a better view of the vehicles there.</Reasoning>
