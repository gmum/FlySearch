<Reasoning>I need to reconsider my search strategy. While I've found the yellow vehicle, I don't see the trash pile I'm looking for in this area. Let me move back up towards the northern area of the dock where there seemed to be more activity and potential debris. I'll move to (-6, 6) while maintaining this good low altitude.</Reasoning>
