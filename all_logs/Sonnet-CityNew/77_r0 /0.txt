<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an area with some objects near the dock/port area. To get a better view and begin my search, I'll move towards the center-right area where there seems to be some activity and reduce altitude significantly to get a clearer view of any potential trash piles. I'll aim for coordinates (27, 0) and reduce height by 50 meters to get closer to the ground.</Reasoning>
