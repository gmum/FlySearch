<Reasoning>I see what appears to be a parking lot area, but I need to move back towards where I saw the potential trash pile near the yellow equipment. I'll move back towards the previous area and adjust slightly to get a better view of that location. I'll move to (-8, -8) to get back to that area while maintaining a low altitude.</Reasoning>
