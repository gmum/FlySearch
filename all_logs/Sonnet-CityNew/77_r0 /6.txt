<Reasoning>I see a yellow vehicle in the bottom-left corner of the image, which matches what I spotted earlier. I should move towards that direction as it might be near the trash pile I'm looking for. I'll move to (-6, -6) to get a better view of that area while maintaining this optimal low altitude.</Reasoning>
