<Reasoning>Now that I have a better view from this higher altitude, I can see more of the area. I notice some yellow vehicles along the right side of the image. I'll move towards (19, 19) where there appears to be more activity and potential debris, and then reduce altitude to get a better look.</Reasoning>
