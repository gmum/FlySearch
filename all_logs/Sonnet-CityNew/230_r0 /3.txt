<Reasoning>
I am now positioned directly above the yellow taxi at 9 meters altitude, which is within the required 10-meter range. The yellow vehicle is clearly visible in my field of view and appears to be the anomaly in this urban environment, standing out from the other darker-colored vehicles. My position is optimal for observation.</Reasoning>
