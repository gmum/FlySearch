<Reasoning>
At 37 meters, I now have a clearer view of the street level and buildings. I can see some vehicles and urban infrastructure, but I need to go lower to better identify any potential anomalies. I'll maintain my current position but descend further to get a closer look at the street level where an anomaly might be more noticeable.</Reasoning>
