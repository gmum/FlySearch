From this aerial view at 67 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search. I notice what appears to be building rooftops and structures. I'll start by moving to the center position (0, 0) and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. This will give me a central vantage point to spot any anomalies while getting closer to the required altitude for identification.</Reasoning>
