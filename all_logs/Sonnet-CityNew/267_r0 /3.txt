I seem to be having trouble with descent movements. Let me try a different approach. I notice a vertical seam or line in the surface, and the bright anomaly is near it. I'll move slightly to (13, -13) to get a different perspective while maintaining the current altitude before attempting any further descent.</Reasoning>
