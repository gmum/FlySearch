Now I have a much better view of the entire area. I can see we're looking at what appears to be a rooftop with various structures and a building to the left. I notice what might be our anomaly - there appears to be some kind of unusual feature or opening near the center of the roof. Let me move to (20, 0) to get a better view while maintaining this safer altitude.</Reasoning>
