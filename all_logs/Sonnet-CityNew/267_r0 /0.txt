<Reasoning>
From this aerial view at 78 meters, I can see what appears to be a parking lot or rooftop area. To effectively search for any anomalies, I should first move to a more central position and lower my altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinate (0, 0) and descend by 40 meters to get a clearer view of the area.</Reasoning>
