I need to be more cautious with altitude changes. I can see what appears to be a bright anomaly in the lower portion of the image. Let me move towards it but with a smaller altitude change this time. I'll move to (0, -13) and descend by 15 meters to get a better look while maintaining safe distance.</Reasoning>
