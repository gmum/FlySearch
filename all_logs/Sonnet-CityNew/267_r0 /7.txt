I'm encountering safety limits in multiple directions. Given that I can see what appears to be the anomaly (bright spot) in the lower portion, let me try moving upward first to get a better overall view of the area. I'll ascend by 20 meters while staying at my current position to better understand the safe navigation paths.</Reasoning>
