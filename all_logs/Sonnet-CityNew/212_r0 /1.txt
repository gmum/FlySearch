<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can now see what appears to be a yellow taxi or vehicle in the southern part of the intersection. This could be our anomaly, but I need to get lower to confirm. I'll move slightly south and continue descending to get a better view of this yellow object.</Reasoning>
