<Reasoning>I can see an urban intersection from a high altitude. To effectively search for anomalies, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll maintain my current horizontal position but descend by 40 meters to get a clearer view of the street level while still maintaining enough height to scan a wide area.</Reasoning>
