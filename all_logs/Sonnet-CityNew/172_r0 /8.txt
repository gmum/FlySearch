<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a transition between levels or a ramp area. Given that I've had several emergency stops and have made multiple moves already, I need to be very careful with my next move. I can see some open space towards the right side of the image. I'll try to move in that direction while maintaining the current altitude to avoid any structural hazards.</Reasoning>
