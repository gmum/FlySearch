<Reasoning>The current view is too dark to make out any details. I need to move to an area with better lighting. Looking at the previous image, there was better visibility in the northern section. I'll move towards (0, 25) and maintain the same altitude for now until I can get a clearer view of the search area.</Reasoning>
