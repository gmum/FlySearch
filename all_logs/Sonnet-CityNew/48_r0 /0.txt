<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a street view from above. Since I'm looking for a fire, I need to scan the area systematically. I notice there might be some activity near the coordinates (0, 28), where there appears to be something yellow on the road. I should move closer to investigate this area and reduce altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
