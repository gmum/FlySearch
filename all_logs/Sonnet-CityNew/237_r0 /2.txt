<Reasoning>I can see a circular marking on the pavement that appears to be the anomaly we're looking for, located near coordinates (0, 9). I'm already at a good altitude of 13 meters, but I need to center directly over the circular marking to be precisely positioned. I'll make a small adjustment to center over it while maintaining this altitude.</Reasoning>
