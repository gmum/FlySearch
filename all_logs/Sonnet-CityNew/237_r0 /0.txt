<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a road with some vehicles along the top of the image, and a body of water below it. Since I need to search for an anomaly, I should start by getting a closer look at the area. I'll move to a central position and lower my altitude to better observe any potential anomalies. I'll aim for the center coordinates (0, 0) and reduce altitude by 30 meters to get a better view.</Reasoning>
