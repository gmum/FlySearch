<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a dark object near the road in the upper portion of the image, around coordinates (0, 29). This could be the anomaly we're looking for. I'll move closer to that position and continue reducing altitude to get a better look and get within the required 10-meter range.</Reasoning>
