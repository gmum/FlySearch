<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the road construction site directly in my field of view. I'm already at 9 meters altitude which is within the required range (below 10 meters). The construction work is centered in my view, so my current position is optimal. Since all conditions are met - I can see the construction site, I'm centered on it, and I'm below 10 meters altitude - I can confirm the target is found.</Reasoning>
FOUND
