<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be road construction work in the image, with some darker pavement sections. To get a better view and position myself correctly, I should move towards the center of this area and significantly reduce altitude to get below 10 meters as required. I'll move to coordinates (0,0) which appears to be near the construction area, and reduce height by 25 meters to get closer to the target.</Reasoning>
