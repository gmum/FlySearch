<Reasoning>I can now see the anomalous object more clearly - it appears to be some kind of brown/reddish discoloration on the road. I need to get closer to it to confirm, but I'm still too high. Since I'm directly above it now, I'll try to descend vertically while maintaining my position.</Reasoning>
