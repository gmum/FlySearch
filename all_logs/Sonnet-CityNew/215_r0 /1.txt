<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see more details of the area. I notice what appears to be an unusual dark/reddish spot or anomaly near coordinates (18, -18). To investigate this potential object of interest, I'll move closer to that position and continue lowering my altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
