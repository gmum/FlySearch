<Reasoning>From this new position, I can still see the anomaly on the road. Since my previous attempts to get closer were too aggressive, I'll try a more conservative approach by moving to (0, 0) and making a very small altitude adjustment. This should help me maintain visual contact while safely getting closer.</Reasoning>
