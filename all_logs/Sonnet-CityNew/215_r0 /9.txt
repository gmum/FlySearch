<Reasoning>I seem to be unable to safely descend further in this urban environment. The buildings and structures are preventing me from getting below 10 meters of the anomaly while maintaining safe clearance. I've used up my moves and haven't been able to achieve the objective of getting below 10 meters while maintaining visual contact with the object.</Reasoning>
