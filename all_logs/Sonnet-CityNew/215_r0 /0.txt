<Reasoning>I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. From this high altitude (85m), I can see a good overview of the urban environment. I notice what appears to be roads and buildings from an aerial view. To begin my search effectively, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while maintaining a position that allows me to scan the area. I'll move to a more central position and decrease altitude by 30 meters.</Reasoning>
