<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a crowd of people gathered near coordinates (26, 26). Since this matches what I'm looking for, I'll move towards that location and descend closer to get a better view. I'll move to those coordinates and reduce altitude by 68 meters to get to about 9 meters above ground level, which will put me below the required 10-meter threshold.</Reasoning>
