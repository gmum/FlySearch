<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a small orange/reddish object near coordinates (0, 0). It looks like this could be our anomaly as it's clearly different from the typical elements in a parking garage environment. I'm already at a good altitude (9 meters) and need to center directly over it.</Reasoning>
