<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a yellow object around coordinates (18, 0). It seems out of place in the urban environment and could be the anomaly I'm looking for. I'll move closer to that position and reduce altitude to get a better view and position myself below 10 meters relative to the object.</Reasoning>
