<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a yellow taxi, but this is likely not our anomaly as taxis are common in urban environments. I notice what appears to be an orange/reddish object near coordinates (-3, 3) that seems out of place. I'll move slightly in that direction while maintaining my low altitude to investigate.</Reasoning>
