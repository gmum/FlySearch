<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a yellow object in the lower right quadrant of the image, around coordinates (17, -17). This seems out of place compared to the rest of the urban environment which consists mainly of roads, crosswalks, and buildings. I'll move closer to that location and reduce altitude to get a better look.</Reasoning>
