<Reasoning>From this aerial view of an urban intersection, I need to conduct a systematic search for the fire. I notice some potential areas of interest near the buildings. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll move to coordinates (17, 0) and descend by 20 meters to improve visibility while maintaining a safe height for initial search.</Reasoning>
