<Reasoning>I've now completed several moves and haven't found clear signs of fire. I notice I've been primarily searching in a covered street/parking area. Perhaps the fire might be in a different location entirely. Since I'm running out of moves, I should try one last check at a higher vantage point to get a broader view of the surrounding area.</Reasoning>
