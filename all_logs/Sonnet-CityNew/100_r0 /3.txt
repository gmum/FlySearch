<Reasoning>I need to be more cautious about my altitude changes. I can see some dark spots that could be signs of fire or heat. Let me move to a position where I can get a better view of one of these spots, but this time I'll make a smaller altitude adjustment. I'll move to (6, 6) with a modest descent.</Reasoning>
