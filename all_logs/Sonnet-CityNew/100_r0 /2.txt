<Reasoning>I notice what appears to be some dark spots or potential heat marks on the surface. I'll adjust my position slightly and lower my altitude to get a better look at these areas, but I need to be more careful about my movements to avoid collision. Moving to (6, -6) and descending by 8 meters should give me a better view while maintaining safe clearance.</Reasoning>
