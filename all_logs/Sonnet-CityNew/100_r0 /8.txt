<Reasoning>I now have a clearer view and can see this is actually a street view with cars and crosswalks. Given that I've had several emergency stops and haven't found clear signs of fire in this area, I should try searching in a different direction. I'll move towards (10, 10) where I can see more of the street intersection while maintaining this altitude.</Reasoning>
