<Reasoning>I see I keep getting emergency stops, which suggests I'm too close to the structure. I need to maintain this altitude but search systematically. I notice some darker spots that could be heat marks. I'll move to (13, 6) while maintaining the current altitude to investigate that area.</Reasoning>
