<Reasoning>I'm now at a closer view of what appears to be a covered parking or building structure. I don't see any clear signs of fire yet, but I should continue my systematic search. I'll move towards the back of this structure (towards negative y coordinates) and lower my altitude further to get a better view of any potential fire sources.</Reasoning>
