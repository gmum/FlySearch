I need to systematically search the area for any anomalies. From this height and angle, I can see several buildings and streets, but I should get lower to have a better view of potential objects. I notice what appears to be a yellow marking or object near coordinates (49, 49) in the upper right portion of the image. I'll move closer to that area and reduce altitude to get a better look.
