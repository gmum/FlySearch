I can now see the intersection more clearly at 57m altitude. I notice what appears to be a yellow taxi or vehicle in the northeast quadrant of the intersection (around coordinates 38, 19). This could potentially be the anomaly we're looking for. I'll move closer to that position and descend further to get a better look.</Reasoning>
