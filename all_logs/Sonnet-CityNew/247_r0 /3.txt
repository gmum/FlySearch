<Reasoning>
I am now at a good altitude (7 meters) and can clearly see the yellow taxi and other vehicles. The yellow taxi appears to be the most distinctive object in the environment, standing out from the other vehicles. I am already well-positioned and at the correct altitude (below 10 meters), with the potential anomaly in clear view.</Reasoning>
