From this high altitude (97m), I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. I notice this is an urban intersection with tall buildings. The best approach would be to first lower my altitude to get a better view while staying centrally positioned. I'll descend by about 40 meters while staying at the center point to maintain maximum visibility of the intersection and surrounding areas.</Reasoning>
