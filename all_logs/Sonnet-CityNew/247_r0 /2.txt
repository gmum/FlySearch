<Reasoning>
I can now see several vehicles on the street, including a yellow taxi. I need to position myself directly above any potential anomaly and get closer. The most notable object is the yellow taxi in the view. I'll move to position myself directly above it and descend further to get within 10 meters of it to check if it's the anomaly we're looking for.</Reasoning>
