I apologize for the aggressive descent. I need to be more careful around these structures. From this view, I can see the HVAC equipment more clearly on the left, but I should also check other areas. Let me move to the right side of the image and maintain this altitude to search for any anomalies in that direction, away from the dangerous equipment.</Reasoning>
