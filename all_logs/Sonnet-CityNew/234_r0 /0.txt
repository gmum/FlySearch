<Reasoning>
I need to start a systematic search for any anomalies in this urban environment. From my current altitude of 74 meters, I can see a good portion of the area, but I should get lower to better identify any potential objects that don't belong. I notice this is an urban area with buildings, roads, and parking spaces. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view of the surroundings.</Reasoning>
