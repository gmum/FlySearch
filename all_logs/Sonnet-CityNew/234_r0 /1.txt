From this lower altitude, I can see more details. On the left side of the image, I notice some industrial HVAC equipment with large fans. I should continue to lower my altitude and move slightly towards the center-left area for a closer inspection, as industrial equipment areas sometimes contain anomalies. I'll reduce altitude significantly to get a much closer look at this area.</Reasoning>
