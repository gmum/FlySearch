<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see more details of the area between the buildings, but still no clear sign of the trash pile. I should continue to lower my altitude and move slightly to check between these buildings. I notice some darker areas in the negative y direction that might be worth investigating. I'll move towards (0, -16) and continue descending to get a better look.</Reasoning>
