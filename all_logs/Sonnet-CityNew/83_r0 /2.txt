<Reasoning>I can now see more ground details between the buildings. I notice something that might be worth investigating near (0,9). I'll move in that direction and continue lowering altitude to get a closer look at what appears to be some objects on the ground. By getting closer and lower, I should be able to determine if this is the trash pile we're looking for.</Reasoning>
