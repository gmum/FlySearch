<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small fire or bright spot near coordinates (0, 45) on the grid. It looks like a yellow-colored area that could be the fire I'm searching for. I'll move closer to that location and significantly reduce altitude to get a better view and get within the 10-meter requirement.</Reasoning>
