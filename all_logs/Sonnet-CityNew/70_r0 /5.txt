<Reasoning>I see what appears to be a bright light or potential fire near (0, -9). I'll move towards it while maintaining my current altitude to stay safe from the trees and structures I can now see in the view. I need to be more careful about obstacles, but this bright spot needs investigation.</Reasoning>
