<Reasoning>Looking at the new area, there appears to be a bright spot near (26, -13) that could potentially be the fire I'm looking for. I'll move in that direction and decrease altitude to get a closer look, while being careful to maintain a safe distance from any structures. My goal is to get within 10 meters of the potential fire while keeping it in view.</Reasoning>
