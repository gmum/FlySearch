<Reasoning>I still don't see the fire in this area. I should continue my search pattern. I notice I have a wider view now showing coordinates up to (-19,19). I'll move to explore the western area of the grid while maintaining a moderate altitude that allows me to spot the fire while still having a decent field of view.</Reasoning>
