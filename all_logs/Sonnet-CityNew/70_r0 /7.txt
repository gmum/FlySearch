<Reasoning>From this higher vantage point, I can see more clearly. I notice a bright spot near (-22, -11). I'll move in that direction while maintaining this safer altitude, as I've learned there are various obstacles like trees and structures in the area. Once I'm positioned above the area of interest, I can better assess if it's the fire I'm looking for.</Reasoning>
