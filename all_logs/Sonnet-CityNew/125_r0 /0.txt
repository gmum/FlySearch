<Reasoning>From this aerial view, I can see what appears to be a construction area or site at the bottom portion of the image. To get a better view and to get closer to meet the requirement of being below 10 meters above the target, I'll move towards the coordinates near the construction area and significantly reduce altitude. I'll aim for the center of what appears to be the construction site at coordinates (0, -55) and lower my altitude by 75 meters to get closer to the required height.</Reasoning>
