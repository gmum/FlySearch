<Reasoning>I seem to be in a very confined space with limited maneuvering options. Given that I've made multiple unsuccessful attempts to get closer, and considering we only get 9 moves total (which I've now used), I need to acknowledge that I haven't been able to safely reach the target position under 10 meters while maintaining proper safety margins. The space appears too constrained for safe close-range operations.</Reasoning>
