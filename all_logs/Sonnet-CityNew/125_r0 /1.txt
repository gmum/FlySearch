<Reasoning>I need to be more careful with my movements. I see what appears to be construction work, but I need to maintain a safer distance while exploring. I'll move slightly to coordinates (0, -22) and reduce my altitude by a smaller increment of 40 meters to get a better view while maintaining safe distance.</Reasoning>
