<Reasoning>I can now see the construction site more clearly in the middle of the image. Given that I need to be below 10 meters from the target, but also need to be careful not to get too close to surrounding structures, I'll move to position (0, -29) and carefully descend by 78 meters. This should put me at around 9 meters above the construction site while maintaining a safe distance from surrounding structures.</Reasoning>
