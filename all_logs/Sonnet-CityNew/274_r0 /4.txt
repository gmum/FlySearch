I can see what appears to be an unusual circular marking or anomaly near coordinates (6, 3). This looks different from the regular road surface and could be the object we're looking for. I'm already at a good altitude of 8 meters (below 10 meters as required), so I'll move to center myself directly over this anomaly.
