At 18 meters altitude, I can see the street level clearly now. I notice some road markings and what appears to be a normal urban street surface. I need to search for any anomalies by moving along the street. Let me check the southern area by moving to (0, -6) while maintaining this altitude which gives me a good view of the ground.
