From this aerial view at 98 meters, I can see several rooftops and structures. Since I need to find an anomaly, I should start by systematically searching the area. I'll begin by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of any potential anomalies. Moving to coordinates (0, 0) and descending by 40 meters will give me a better vantage point while maintaining enough height to survey the area effectively.
