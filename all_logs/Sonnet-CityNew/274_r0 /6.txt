The circular anomaly is now perfectly centered in my view at coordinates (0, 0). I'm at 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and I have a clear view of the object. This appears to be the anomaly we were searching for - it's a distinct circular marking that stands out from the regular road surface.
