<Reasoning>I now have a clear view of the area but I don't see the fire from this position. I need to move back slightly to get a better view of where I saw the yellow marking. I'll maintain this low altitude as it's within the required range (below 10 meters), but I'll move a bit north to get back to where I saw the potential fire.</Reasoning>
