<Reasoning>I seem to have lost sight of the fire from this position. I must have moved to a different location than intended. From my current view I can see cars and road markings, but not the fire I was tracking. Since I've used 8 out of my 9 allowed moves and I don't have the fire in my field of view, I need to make one final strategic move. I'll try to move back towards where I last saw the fire marking.</Reasoning>
