<Reasoning>I've used all my moves and still haven't managed to get a clear view of the fire in my field of vision while being below 10 meters. From this final position, I can only see cars and building structures, but not the fire I was initially tracking. I was unable to successfully complete the mission within the given constraints.</Reasoning>

I cannot reply with "FOUND" as I do not have the fire in my field of view at this position.
