<Reasoning>From this aerial view of what appears to be a city street between buildings, I don't immediately see a large trash pile. I should perform a systematic search by first lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area, while staying near the center coordinates to maintain good visibility of the street and sidewalks where trash might accumulate. I'll descend by 30 meters to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
