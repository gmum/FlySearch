I've made multiple attempts to approach the bright area that appears to be the fire, but keep getting emergency stops in all directions. I'm currently at 14 meters altitude with the bright spot clearly visible in my field of view. Since I've been unable to safely get below 10 meters due to apparent obstacles, and I've used several moves already, I should try one more careful approach. Let me try moving slightly to the east while maintaining altitude.
