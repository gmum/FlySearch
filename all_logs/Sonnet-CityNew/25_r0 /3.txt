I can now clearly see a bright spot that could be the fire in the lower left portion of the image. I'm at 14 meters altitude which is still above our target of being below 10 meters. However, given the two emergency stops we've had, I need to be more cautious. I'll make a smaller descent while staying in position to get just under 10 meters.
