I have now used all 9 available moves, and despite multiple attempts, I have been unable to safely get below 10 meters due to obstacles in all directions. While I can see the bright spot that appears to be the fire, I cannot meet the requirement of being below 10 meters while maintaining safety. Since I cannot make any more moves and cannot safely get closer, I must conclude this attempt without being able to properly confirm the fire from the required altitude.
