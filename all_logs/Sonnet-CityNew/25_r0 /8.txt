After multiple attempts, I've been unable to safely get below 10 meters or get closer to the bright spot due to constant emergency stops. This suggests there are significant obstacles or safety hazards in all attempted approach directions. While I can see what appears to be the fire, I cannot fulfill the requirement of being below 10 meters while maintaining a safe position. For safety reasons, I should maintain my current position and altitude.
