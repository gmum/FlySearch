From this aerial view at 97 meters, I can see several buildings and structures, but no immediate sign of fire. I need to perform a systematic search starting from a lower altitude to better spot any potential fires. I'll move to a central position and descend to get a closer look at the area around (0,0). This will give me a better vantage point while maintaining a good field of view of the surrounding area.
