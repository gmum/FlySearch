I keep getting emergency stops when trying to descend or move closer to the bright spot. This suggests there might be obstacles or safety concerns at lower altitudes. Since I can clearly see the potential fire from my current position at 14 meters, and further descent attempts are proving dangerous, I should try a different approach. Let me try moving horizontally to get a better angle while maintaining this safer altitude.
