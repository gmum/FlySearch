From my current position at 60 meters altitude, I can see a broad area of the city. I notice what appears to be a yellow vehicle near the coordinates (0, 20), which could potentially be our target green pickup truck. To get a better view and confirm the vehicle's color and type, I need to descend and move slightly towards that position. I'll move to those coordinates and reduce altitude by 30 meters to get a clearer view.
