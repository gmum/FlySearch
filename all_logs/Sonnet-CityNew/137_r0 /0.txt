From this altitude, I can see a parking lot area with several vehicles. Since I'm looking for a police car, I should get lower to better identify the vehicles. I notice what appears to be a small vehicle near coordinate (0, 26). I'll move closer to that position and reduce altitude significantly to get a better view of the vehicles in that area.
