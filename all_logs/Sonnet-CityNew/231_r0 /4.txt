<Reasoning>I need to reevaluate my approach. It seems I'm too close to obstacles when trying to move directly south. Looking at the surface, I notice there appears to be a vertical dividing line (possibly a seam or joint) running through the center. I'll try moving slightly to the east first to get a different angle on the bright anomaly while maintaining altitude.</Reasoning>
