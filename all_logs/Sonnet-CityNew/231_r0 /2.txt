<Reasoning>I notice what appears to be a bright spot or anomaly in the lower portion of the image on what looks like a metallic or concrete surface. I should move towards that bright area to investigate it more closely, but maintain enough distance to avoid collision. I'll move slightly towards that area (south) and reduce altitude moderately.</Reasoning>
