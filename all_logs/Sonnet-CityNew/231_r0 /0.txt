<Reasoning>I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. From this height, I can see several rooftops and structures, but I need to get lower to better identify any potential anomalies. I notice some mechanical equipment on the roofs (like HVAC units), but I should check the central area first at a lower altitude to get a better view. I'll move to the center coordinates and decrease altitude significantly to get a better view of any potential anomalies.</Reasoning>
