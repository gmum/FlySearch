At 24 meters altitude, I can see more detail of the street level. I notice what appears to be some debris or potential trash accumulation near the (-8, -16) coordinate. I'll move towards that position and lower my altitude to about 8 meters to get a very close look and verify if this is the trash pile we're looking for.
