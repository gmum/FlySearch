<Reasoning>
From this initial aerial view at 74 meters, I can see an urban environment with buildings but no obvious large trash pile yet. I should conduct a systematic search by first going to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll move towards (0, 0) which is the center of the grid and descend by 30 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively.
