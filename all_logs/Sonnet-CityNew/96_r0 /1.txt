Now at 44 meters, I have a clearer view but still no obvious trash pile. I should continue searching systematically. I notice there might be some areas to check in the southern part of the grid. I'll move towards (0, -15) and descend another 20 meters to get an even better view of that area while still maintaining enough altitude to continue the search if needed.
