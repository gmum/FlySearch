<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be road construction work in the lower portion of the image, marked by a lighter colored area on the road. I'll move towards the construction site and lower my altitude to get a better view. I'll aim for the coordinates (-11, -23) which appears to be near the center of the construction area, and reduce altitude by 25 meters to get closer to the required height.</Reasoning>
