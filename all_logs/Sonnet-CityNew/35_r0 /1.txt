At this lower altitude, I can see more details of the street below. I notice some vehicles parked on the street, and I need to get an even closer look to identify if any of them is the white pickup truck we're searching for. I'll continue to descend while moving slightly to coordinate (0, 17) where I can see some parked vehicles.
