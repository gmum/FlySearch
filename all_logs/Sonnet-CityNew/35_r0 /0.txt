<Reasoning>
From my current elevated position, I can see several buildings and streets but no white pickup truck. I'll need to systematically search the area while lowering my altitude to get a better view. I'll start by moving towards the center of the visible area and descending to get a clearer view of the streets and potential parking areas.
