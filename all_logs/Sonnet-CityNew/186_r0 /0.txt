<Reasoning>
I can see an intersection with some yellow markings on the road. Since I'm searching for a fire and need to get a better view of the area, I should start by descending to get a closer look at the area where the yellow markings are visible. I'll move towards the coordinate (-13, -13) which is near the yellow road markings, and simultaneously decrease my altitude by 20 meters to get a better view.</Reasoning>
