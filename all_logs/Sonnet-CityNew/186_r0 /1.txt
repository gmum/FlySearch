<Reasoning>
From this lower altitude, I notice what appears to be smoke or a potential fire in the lower-left area near coordinates (-13, -13). I need to get even closer to confirm and position myself directly above it. I'll move slightly to better center on that area and continue descending to get within the required 10-meter range.</Reasoning>
