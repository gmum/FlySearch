I can see parts of what appears to be a parking area or road system. Since I'm looking for a police car, I should systematically search the visible area. I'll start by moving towards the center-right portion of the image (24, 24) where there seems to be better visibility of the ground, and I'll descend to get a better view of any vehicles that might be present.
