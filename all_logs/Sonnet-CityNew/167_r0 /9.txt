<Reasoning>
I apologize, but I have used all 9 allowed moves and have not successfully located the police car in any of the areas I searched. I explored various parts of the parking area and saw several vehicles including a yellow car and a silver car, but no police car was found within my search area. The search was unsuccessful despite maintaining the correct altitude of under 10 meters.
