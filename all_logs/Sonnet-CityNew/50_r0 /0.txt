<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an intersection from a high altitude. Since I'm searching for a fire, I should systematically search the visible area. I'll start by moving closer to the center of the intersection and reducing altitude to get a better view of any potential smoke or flames. The (-25, -25) coordinate appears to be a good central position to begin the search.</Reasoning>
