<Reasoning>I need to be more cautious with altitude changes. I can see what appears to be a metal or concrete surface, but I need to search more of the area to find the road construction site. I'll move towards (21, 21) and maintain a safer altitude for now, only descending by 10 meters to get a slightly closer view while staying safe.</Reasoning>
