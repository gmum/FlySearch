<Reasoning>I appear to be looking at some kind of metal surface or roof, not a road construction site. I need to first gain some altitude to get a better overview of the surrounding area, as I might be too close to a building or structure. I'll increase altitude by 30 meters while staying in the same position to safely assess the wider area.</Reasoning>
