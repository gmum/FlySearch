<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a road construction site in the image. I should move towards the center of the image at coordinates (0, 0) and decrease altitude significantly to get closer to the site for a better view. I'll descend by 82 meters to get to about 9 meters above ground level, which will put me under the 10-meter requirement.</Reasoning>
