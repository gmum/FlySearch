From this aerial view at 34 meters, I can see a city street with buildings on either side. I don't immediately see any fire, but I need to conduct a systematic search. I'll start by lowering my altitude and moving slightly forward to get a better view of the center area of the street. This will allow me to scan more carefully for any signs of fire while maintaining a safe distance from the buildings.
