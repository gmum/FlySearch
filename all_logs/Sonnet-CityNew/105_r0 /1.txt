At 19 meters altitude, I have a clearer view but still don't see any obvious signs of fire. However, I notice what appears to be some smoke or haze near the bottom of the image. I should move lower and slightly towards that area to investigate more closely. I'll reduce altitude significantly to get under 10 meters while moving slightly south to check that area.
