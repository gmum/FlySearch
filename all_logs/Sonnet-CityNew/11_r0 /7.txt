<Reasoning>I need to be more cautious about altitude changes due to the buildings. I can see the black truck in the street below, and I'll try a smaller altitude adjustment while maintaining my position over it. I'll reduce height by just 25 meters which should put me at about 9 meters above the target while staying clear of obstacles.</Reasoning>
