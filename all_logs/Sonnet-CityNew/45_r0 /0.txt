<Reasoning>From this aerial view at 80 meters, I can see an urban environment with buildings, roads, and intersections. I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. Since it could be hidden between buildings or in less visible areas, I should first try to get a better view by descending to a lower altitude while staying in a central position. This will give me a clearer view of the area while maintaining good coverage.</Reasoning>
