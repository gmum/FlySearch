<Reasoning>At 40 meters altitude, I can now see more detail. I notice what appears to be a dark area in the western portion of the image, which could potentially be the trash pile we're looking for. I'll move towards that area (around -27, 0) and descend further to get a closer look and verify if this is our target.</Reasoning>
