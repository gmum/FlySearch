From this aerial view at 88 meters, I can see a city intersection but no clear crowd yet. I need to perform a systematic search pattern and get lower to have a better view of the area. I'll start by moving to the center of the intersection at (0,0) and reducing altitude by 40 meters to get a clearer view of the ground level activity.
