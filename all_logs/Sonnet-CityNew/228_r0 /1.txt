From this new position, I can see more details of the urban environment, including what appears to be architectural details of a building. There's still no clear anomaly visible yet. I should continue descending while moving slightly towards (19, 19) to get a better view of that area which seems to have interesting architectural features. This will help me search more thoroughly at a lower altitude.
