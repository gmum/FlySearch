From this high aerial view of what appears to be an urban environment, I can see several buildings, streets, and construction areas. To effectively search for an anomaly, I should first move to a lower altitude to get a better view while maintaining a central position. I'll descend about 40 meters while moving slightly towards the center of the visible area to ensure I can systematically search the area.
