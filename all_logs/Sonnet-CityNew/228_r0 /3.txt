I can now see what appears to be a parking area with some lighting fixtures. There's a blue sign that says "Parking" which could be considered an anomaly in this environment. I'm already at a good altitude (7 meters) which is below 10 meters, and I'm centered on what appears to be the anomalous object (the blue parking sign). Since I'm both below 10 meters and have the potential anomaly in my field of view, I can now confirm the find.
