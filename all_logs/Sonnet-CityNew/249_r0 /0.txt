I need to start a systematic search for any anomalies in this urban environment. The image shows a street with buildings on both sides. I notice some vehicles and regular urban infrastructure, but nothing immediately stands out as anomalous. I should first move to a more central position and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll move towards (0, 0) and reduce height by 20 meters to get a clearer view of the street level.
