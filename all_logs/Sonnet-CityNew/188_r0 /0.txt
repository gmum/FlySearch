<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an alleyway between buildings from a high vantage point. From this height and position, I can see some vehicles and the ground below, but I need to get lower and search more carefully for any signs of fire. I'll move down and slightly forward to get a better view of the area around (0, 0) as it's in the center of my field of view.</Reasoning>
