<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a fire or orange glow around coordinates (9, 5) on the left side of the image. I need to move closer to that location and get even lower to confirm. I'll move towards those coordinates while descending further to get within 10 meters of the potential fire.</Reasoning>
