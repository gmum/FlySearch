<Reasoning>I don't see the trash pile clearly in this area. I'm at a good altitude (9 meters) but I need to continue searching. Given that we've explored several areas without success and have limited moves left, I should check the northeastern area where I noticed some irregular objects earlier. I'll move towards (6, 3) while maintaining this altitude.</Reasoning>
