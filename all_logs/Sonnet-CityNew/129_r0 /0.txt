<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be some buildings and streets from a high altitude. I don't immediately see a large trash pile from this height and position. I should start by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll move to coordinates (0,0) and decrease altitude by 30 meters to get a better overview of the central area.</Reasoning>
