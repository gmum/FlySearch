<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see more ground details. I notice some potential debris or objects in the northeastern area of my view (around the positive x and y coordinates). I should investigate that area more closely. I'll move towards (13, 13) and lower my altitude further by 10 meters to get a better look at what appears to be some accumulated materials.</Reasoning>
