<Reasoning>Unfortunately, I don't see the trash pile in this area either - I mostly see trees and some benches or structures. I've used up my moves but haven't been able to definitively locate the large trash pile. From the areas I've explored, I wasn't able to find the target object while maintaining safe flight operations.</Reasoning>
<Action>Search incomplete - could not locate target within move limit</Action>
