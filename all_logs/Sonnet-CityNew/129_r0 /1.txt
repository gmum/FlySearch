<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see more details but I still don't spot the trash pile clearly. I notice the intersection and surrounding areas better now. I should explore the eastern side of the area (positive x coordinates) where there seems to be more open space, and continue lowering altitude for better visibility. I'll move towards (27, 0) and decrease altitude by another 20 meters.</Reasoning>
