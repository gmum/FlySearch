<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a collection of trash or debris near (-6, 3) in my view. I should move directly over it to confirm and maintain my current low altitude which is good for observation as it's already below 10 meters. This position should give me a clear view of the trash pile.</Reasoning>
