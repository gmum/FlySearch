<Reasoning>
From this altitude and initial position, I can see several vehicles on the street, but I need to get lower to better identify if any of them is the blue sport car I'm looking for. I notice some cars parked along the street near coordinates (18, 18). I'll move to that position and lower my altitude significantly to get a better view of these vehicles.
