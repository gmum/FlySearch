From this new position and lower altitude, I can see better detail of this area, but I don't see the blue sport car here. I should move toward the street where I saw more vehicles. I'll move to coordinates (8, 8) which will get me closer to the main street area, and I'll continue lowering my altitude to get a better view of the vehicles.
