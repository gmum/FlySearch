I seem to be in a very dangerous position surrounded by obstacles. Since I've been unsuccessful in several movement attempts and keep encountering emergency stops, I should return to the starting position at a safe altitude. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) while maintaining my current altitude, which should get me back to a known safe position.
