<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a dead or unusual-looking tree on the left side of the image near (-8, 4). This seems out of place in the urban environment and could be our anomaly. I'll move closer to it and lower my altitude just a bit more to get within the required 10 meters.</Reasoning>
