<Reasoning>I can now see several yellow taxis on the street. However, taxis are common in an urban environment and likely not the anomaly we're looking for. I notice something that might be unusual near (-21, -21) - there appears to be a darker object that seems out of place. I'll move in that direction and lower my altitude further to investigate.</Reasoning>
