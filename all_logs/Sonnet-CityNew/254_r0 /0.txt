<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be yellow objects (possibly taxis or vehicles) in the lower left portion of the image, which could be potential anomalies. I'll move closer to that area and reduce altitude to get a better view. I'll aim for coordinates (-41, -21) to investigate those yellow objects while descending 30 meters.</Reasoning>
