<Reasoning>I can see an urban environment with buildings and streets from a high altitude. Since I'm looking for a fire and don't immediately see one, I should first try to get a lower altitude for a better view while maintaining a central position. I'll move to the center coordinates and decrease altitude significantly to get a better view of the area.</Reasoning>
