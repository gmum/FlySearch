<Reasoning>
From this aerial view at 51 meters, I can see several streets and buildings, but I need to conduct a systematic search for the white sport car. I'll start by moving to a more central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. The intersection near (0, 17) looks like a good starting point as it provides a clear view of the street where cars would likely be.
