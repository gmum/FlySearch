<Reasoning>I still need to continue searching for signs of fire. From this new position and lower altitude, I can see more detail but no obvious signs of fire yet. I'll move to the south portion of the visible area (0, -9) and descend another 10 meters to get an even closer look at any potential fire sources.</Reasoning>
