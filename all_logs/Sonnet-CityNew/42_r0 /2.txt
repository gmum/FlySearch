<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a red glow in the upper right quadrant of the image, which could be the fire we're looking for. I'll move to position (5, 11) to get closer to that red glow and descend by 8 meters to get below 10 meters altitude, which will put me in the optimal position to confirm the fire.</Reasoning>
