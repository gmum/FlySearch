<Reasoning>I need to perform a systematic search for any signs of fire. From this aerial view of what appears to be an urban environment with buildings and streets, I should start by lowering my altitude to get a better view while maintaining a position that gives me good visibility. I'll move to a central position (15, 0) and descend by 20 meters to better observe any potential smoke or flames.</Reasoning>
