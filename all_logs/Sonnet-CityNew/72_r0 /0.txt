<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small fire or red glow near the center of the image, slightly towards the bottom. To investigate this properly, I need to lower my altitude significantly and move slightly towards that location. I'll move to coordinates (0, -30) which should position me better over what might be the fire, and I'll descend by 80 meters to get much closer to the ground.</Reasoning>
