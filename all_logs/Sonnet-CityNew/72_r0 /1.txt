<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see the area better but I don't see any active fire in my current field of view. The red glow I thought I saw might have been a reflection or marking. I need to search systematically. I notice some darker areas that should be investigated. I'll move slightly north to check that area while maintaining this low altitude which is good for detailed observation.</Reasoning>
