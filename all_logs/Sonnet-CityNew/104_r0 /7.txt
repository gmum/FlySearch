FOUND

<Reasoning>I have located the police car and I am positioned directly above it at 10 meters altitude, which meets the requirement of being below 10 meters or at 10 meters. The vehicle is clearly visible in my field of view and I can confirm it is a police car with its distinctive markings and lights.</Reasoning>
