<Reasoning>I can see a portion of the road from my current position. Since I'm looking for a police car, I should systematically search the visible road area. I notice some vehicles on the road, but I need to get lower and move towards the center of the road to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (0,0) and lower my altitude to get a clearer view of the vehicles.</Reasoning>
