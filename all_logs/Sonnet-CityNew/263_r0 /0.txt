<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a bright circular object on the right side of the image, around coordinates (39, 20). This could be the anomaly I'm looking for, as it stands out from the surrounding environment. I'll move closer to that position and reduce altitude to get a better look.</Reasoning>
