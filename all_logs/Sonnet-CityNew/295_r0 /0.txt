I can see what appears to be a road intersection with water on one side. Since I need to perform a systematic search for an anomaly, I'll start by moving towards the center of my visible area and lowering my altitude to get a better view. Moving to coordinate (0,0) which is near the middle of the visible area, and descending by 30 meters to get a clearer view of any potential anomalies.
