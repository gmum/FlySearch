From this new position and lower altitude, I can see more details of the area. I notice there's a pier or dock structure extending into the water. I'll move closer to the dock area and lower my altitude further to search for any anomalies along the structure. Moving to coordinate (0, -14) and descending another 20 meters to get a closer look at the dock area.
