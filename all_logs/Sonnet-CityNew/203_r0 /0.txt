<Reasoning>I can see a highway intersection from a high altitude. To effectively search for any anomalies, I should first move closer to the center of the intersection while reducing altitude to get a better view. This will give me a good vantage point to spot anything unusual. I'll move to (0, 0) coordinates and descend by 40 meters to get a clearer view.</Reasoning>
