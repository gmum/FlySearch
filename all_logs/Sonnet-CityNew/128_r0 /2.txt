<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be smoke or fire in the lower left portion of the image more clearly. I'll move closer to that spot and descend further to get within 10 meters of it. Moving to (-14, -14) and descending by 12 meters should put me at a good position to confirm if this is the fire we're looking for.</Reasoning>
