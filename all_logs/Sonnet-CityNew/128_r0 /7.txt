<Reasoning>Now that I'm at a higher altitude, I can see the power line layout better. The smoke/fire appears to be visible in the lower portion of the image. I'll try approaching from a different angle by moving to (13, -27) which should give me a clearer view from the road side while staying above the power lines.</Reasoning>
