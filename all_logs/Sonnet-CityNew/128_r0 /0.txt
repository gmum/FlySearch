<Reasoning>I need to systematically search for any signs of fire in this urban environment. I notice what appears to be a highway or major road with parking lots and buildings nearby. Since I'm starting at 81 meters, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while moving to a central position. I'll move towards the center coordinates (0, 0) and descend by 30 meters to get a better view of the area.</Reasoning>
