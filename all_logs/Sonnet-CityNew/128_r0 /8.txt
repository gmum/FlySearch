<Reasoning>From this position, I can see the smoke/fire area more clearly, and I've managed to avoid the power lines. I'm now at a safer vantage point but still need to get closer while maintaining safety. I'll descend carefully to get within 10 meters of the fire while staying at these coordinates, which should give me a clear view while avoiding the infrastructure.</Reasoning>
