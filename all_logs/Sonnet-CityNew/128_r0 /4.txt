<Reasoning>I need to be much more cautious due to the power lines in the area. Given the infrastructure constraints, I should maintain a safer altitude and position. I can see the potential fire/smoke area, but I need to approach it from a different angle. Let me move to (0, -13) while maintaining the current altitude to get a better view while staying clear of the power lines.</Reasoning>
