<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see the area more clearly. I notice what might be some smoke or disturbance in the lower left portion of the image. I should investigate that area and lower my altitude further to get a better look. I'll move towards that area (around -34, -34) and descend another 30 meters.</Reasoning>
