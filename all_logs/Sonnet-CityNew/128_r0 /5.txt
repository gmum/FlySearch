<Reasoning>I need to completely rethink my approach. The power lines are creating a significant hazard in this area. Instead of trying to get closer to the smoke/fire area which is blocked by power lines, I should try moving to a safer position on the other side. Let me move to (7, -7) while maintaining altitude, which should give me a view from the road side while staying clear of the infrastructure.</Reasoning>
