<Reasoning>I apologize, but I seem to be too constrained by the infrastructure to safely reach the fire while maintaining the required altitude and safety parameters. The combination of power lines, buildings, and other structures is making it impossible to get within 10 meters of the fire without risking collision. I should report that the area is too hazardous for close drone inspection and recommend alternative methods for fire assessment.</Reasoning>
