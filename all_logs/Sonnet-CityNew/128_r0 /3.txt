<Reasoning>I apologize for the unsafe maneuver. I notice there are power lines or infrastructure in the area that I need to be careful of. I can see what appears to be smoke or fire in the lower portion of the image. I'll make a more careful approach by moving to (-7, -13) and descending by just 11 meters to stay safe while getting closer to investigate.</Reasoning>
