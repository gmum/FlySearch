<Reasoning>I can see an aerial view of what appears to be a city intersection with tall buildings and streets. I need to scan the area systematically to find any crowds. From this height and angle, it's difficult to spot people clearly, so I should decrease altitude and move towards the intersection center where people are most likely to gather. I'll move to the center coordinates and lower the altitude significantly to get a better view.</Reasoning>
