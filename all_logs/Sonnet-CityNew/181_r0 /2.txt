<Reasoning>I have now found the crowd and I'm at an appropriate altitude (9 meters, which is below 10 meters as required). The crowd is clearly visible in my field of view, and I am properly centered above them. Since all conditions are met - the crowd is in view, I'm centered, and my altitude is below 10 meters - I can confirm the find.</Reasoning>
