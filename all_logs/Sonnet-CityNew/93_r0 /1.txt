<Reasoning>At this lower altitude, I have a clearer view but still no obvious signs of fire. I notice what appears to be a rooftop with some structures on it. I should continue to decrease altitude while moving slightly towards the (-19, 0) coordinates to check that area more thoroughly. This will help me get a better view of any potential fire sources while maintaining visual coverage of the central area.</Reasoning>
