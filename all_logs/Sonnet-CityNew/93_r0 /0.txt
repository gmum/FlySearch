<Reasoning>I need to systematically search the area for any signs of fire. From this height, I can see several buildings and structures, but no immediate signs of fire. The best strategy would be to lower my altitude to get a better view while moving towards the center of my visible area. I'll move to coordinates (0,0) which appears to be near a central position, and simultaneously decrease altitude by 30 meters to get a better view.</Reasoning>
