<Reasoning>I've used up my allowed moves and haven't been able to successfully locate and confirm the fire while maintaining a safe distance below 10 meters. The task requirements for finding the fire (being below 10 meters and centered on it) haven't been met within the move limit. In retrospect, I should have been more strategic about approaching the potential fire locations while carefully managing altitude changes.</Reasoning>
