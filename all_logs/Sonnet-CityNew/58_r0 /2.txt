I can see better detail now at this lower altitude. I notice what appears to be an orange/reddish structure or object near (-5, 0). Given that fires often appear in reddish/orange colors, I should investigate this area more closely. I'll move to that position and lower my altitude further to get within 10 meters of it.</Reasoning>
