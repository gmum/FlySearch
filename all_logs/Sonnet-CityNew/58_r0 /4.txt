I need to be more careful about maintaining safe distances. From my current position, I can see what appears to be an orange/red vertical structure. Instead of getting too close to it, I'll move to (0, 0) and maintain my current altitude, which should give me a good view while keeping a safe distance from structures.</Reasoning>
