I apologize for the unsafe maneuver. I can now see what appears to be the orange/red object more clearly, but I need to maintain a safer distance while still getting close enough to confirm. I'll adjust my position slightly to (-4, 0) and go down just a bit more to get within 10 meters while maintaining safe clearance from structures.</Reasoning>
