<Reasoning>
From this position over the water, I can see that there are no signs of fire in this area. The orange/red element we saw earlier was indeed just part of the infrastructure. Since I've now searched both sides of the dock area and found no fire, and I've used my allowed moves, I should conclude this search mission.</Reasoning>

I don't see any fire in the search area after completing a thorough inspection of both the dock and water sides of the location.
