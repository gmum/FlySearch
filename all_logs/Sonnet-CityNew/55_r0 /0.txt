<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an urban environment from a high altitude. Since I'm looking for a fire, I need to conduct a systematic search. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view. Looking at the grid, I'll move towards (0,0) which appears to be near the intersection, and reduce altitude by 30 meters to get a clearer view of the area.</Reasoning>
