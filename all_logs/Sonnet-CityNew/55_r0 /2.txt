<Reasoning>I can see a bright spot near (0, -7) that could potentially be a fire. I'll move closer to that location and lower my altitude by 12 meters to get within the required 10-meter range. This will put me at approximately 8 meters above ground level, which meets the requirement of being below 10 meters while still maintaining a safe distance.</Reasoning>
