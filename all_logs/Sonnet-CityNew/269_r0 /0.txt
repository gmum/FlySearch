<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an intersection from above. Given that I need to search for an anomaly, I should start by getting a closer look at the area. I notice some movement or objects near the center of the intersection. I'll move to that central position (0, 0) and lower my altitude significantly to get a better view of anything unusual.</Reasoning>
