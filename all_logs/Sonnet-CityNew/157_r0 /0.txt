<Reasoning>I can see an urban environment from a high altitude. Since I'm looking for a trash pile, I should systematically search the area while gradually decreasing altitude to get a better view. I'll start by moving towards the center-right area (33, 33) and descending 30 meters to get a better view of the ground level details.</Reasoning>
