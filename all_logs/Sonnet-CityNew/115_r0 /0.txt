<Reasoning>
From this aerial view of what appears to be a downtown area, I need to conduct a systematic search for a road construction site. The image shows an urban environment with buildings, and I should start by getting a bit lower to have a better view while moving to explore more of the area. I'll move towards the negative coordinates and reduce altitude to get a better view of potential construction sites that might be blocked by buildings in the current perspective.
