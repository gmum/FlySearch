I can now see what appears to be fire truck lights at street level. This is likely where the fire emergency is located. I need to get closer while being careful of the buildings on either side. I'll descend carefully to get a better view while staying centered over this position, reducing altitude by 20 meters to maintain safe clearance from structures.
