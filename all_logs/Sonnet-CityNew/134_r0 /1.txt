Now at 46 meters, I have a clearer view but still need to get much lower to properly identify any potential fire. I can see some structures on the roof more clearly now. I'll continue to descend significantly while maintaining my position at (0,0) to get a closer look at this central area. I'll drop another 30 meters to get much closer to the required height of under 10 meters.
