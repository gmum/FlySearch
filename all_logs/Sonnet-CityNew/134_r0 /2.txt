I apologize for the unsafe maneuver. Now at 30 meters, I can see what appears to be a rooftop surface with some discoloration. I need to maintain a safer distance while continuing my search. I'll move slightly to (10, 10) to investigate that area while descending more gradually this time, only by 15 meters to avoid any potential collisions with roof structures.
