I need to be more cautious. At 30 meters, I'm still getting a view of the rooftop surface. I notice some dark spots and discoloration that should be investigated. Let me move to (-10, -10) to check that area, but this time I'll maintain the current altitude to ensure safety while I survey more of the area.
