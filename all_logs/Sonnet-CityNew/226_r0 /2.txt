I can now see several parked vehicles on the street more clearly. There's a yellow taxi, a white vehicle, and a green vehicle. I need to get closer to properly inspect if any of these might be the anomaly we're looking for. I'll descend a bit more to get below 10 meters while staying centered over the street area.</Reasoning>
