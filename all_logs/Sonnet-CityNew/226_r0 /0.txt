From this high vantage point looking down at what appears to be a historic building with columns and architectural details, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies. I'll first descend to get a better view while staying roughly centered, as being at 65 meters makes it difficult to spot small details. I'll move slightly to coordinate (0,0) to center myself and descend by 30 meters to get a better view of the area.</Reasoning>
