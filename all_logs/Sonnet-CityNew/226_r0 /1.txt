At this lower altitude, I can see the street level better. There appear to be some vehicles parked along the street. I notice what might be a white object that seems out of place among the other parked vehicles. I'll descend further and move slightly towards coordinate (0,-12) to get a closer look at the street level objects.</Reasoning>
