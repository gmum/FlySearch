<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a pile of trash or debris near coordinates (0, -11). I should move closer to that location and lower my altitude to get a better view and confirm if this is the target object. I'll move directly to those coordinates and descend to about 8 meters above ground level to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining a safe distance.</Reasoning>
