<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the pile of logs/trash at the bottom right of the image. I need to center myself directly above it for a proper view. The pile appears to be around coordinates (5, -5). Since I'm already at a good altitude of 8 meters (below the required 10 meters), I'll maintain this height while moving to center over the target.</Reasoning>
