<Reasoning>I notice a dark spot near coordinates (-20, 0) that could potentially be smoke or fire damage. Since my objective is to find a fire and I need to be below 10 meters when I confirm it, I'll move to that location and descend to 8 meters to get a better look. This altitude will put me well within the required range while maintaining safe operational height.</Reasoning>
