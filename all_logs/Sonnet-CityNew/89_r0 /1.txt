<Reasoning>From this closer view, I can see what appears to be an orange/red object near (5, 5) which could be the fire I'm looking for. Since I'm already at 8 meters altitude, which is good for my objective of being below 10 meters, I'll move directly to those coordinates to investigate while maintaining the same height.</Reasoning>
