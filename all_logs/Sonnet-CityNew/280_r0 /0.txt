I can see an urban environment with a highway/bridge structure and parking areas. From this height and position, I need to conduct a systematic search. I notice red vehicles in the parking area to the left side of the image. Since anomalies might be more visible in less cluttered areas, I'll first move towards the center and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area, particularly around the intersection with the yellow markings.
