<Reasoning>
From this lower altitude, I can see the intersection more clearly with its yellow crosswalk markings. I notice some parked vehicles but nothing that appears particularly out of place yet. I'll continue to lower my altitude and move slightly towards the intersection center to get a better view of the entire crossing area, as unusual objects might be more noticeable in this well-lit, open space.
