<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a yellow taxi/car on the street, which seems out of place compared to the other vehicles. It's located towards the left side of the image, around coordinates (-30, 0). Since I need to get closer and below 10 meters to confirm this anomaly, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude to get a better look.</Reasoning>
