<Reasoning>I can see the yellow vehicle more clearly now. I'll make a smaller, more careful movement to position myself directly above it while descending a bit more to get under 10 meters. Looking at the grid, the yellow vehicle appears to be around coordinates (4, -4). I'll move there and descend 5 more meters to get to about 8 meters altitude.</Reasoning>
