<Reasoning>I can see a city intersection from a high altitude, but no road construction site is immediately visible. I should first lower my altitude to get a better view of the area, and move slightly towards the northeast quadrant where there appears to be more street visibility. I'll descend by 30 meters while moving to coordinates (19, 19) to begin a more detailed search.</Reasoning>
