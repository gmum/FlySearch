<Reasoning>I can now see some markings on the road surface more clearly, and there appears to be some road work or construction activity near the intersection. I need to get even lower to confirm this is the construction site, while staying centered over the area. I'll descend another 12 meters to get below the 10-meter threshold required for confirmation.</Reasoning>
