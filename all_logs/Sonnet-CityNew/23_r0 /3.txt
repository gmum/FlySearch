<Reasoning>I realize now that I'm in a very confined urban space with tall buildings around me. Moving laterally seems risky due to the buildings. The safest approach would be to maintain my current position and only adjust my altitude to get a better view of the street below. I'll reduce altitude by just 5 meters to stay safe while improving my view.</Reasoning>
