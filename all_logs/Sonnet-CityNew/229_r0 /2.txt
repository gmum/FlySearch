<Reasoning>I can now clearly see what appears to be the anomalous object - it looks like some kind of unusual structure or cover on the ground. I'm already at a good altitude (9 meters) and centered on the object, which is within my field of view. This meets all the criteria - below 10 meters altitude and the object is clearly visible.</Reasoning>
