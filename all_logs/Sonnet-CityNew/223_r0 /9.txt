<Reasoning>
I have now used all 9 available moves and have been unable to safely get closer to the anomaly. While I can see the blue-grey structure that appears to be the target, I haven't been able to get below 10 meters of it safely. I'm currently at 25 meters altitude, which is too high to declare "FOUND" according to the mission parameters. The mission has been unsuccessful.</Reasoning>
