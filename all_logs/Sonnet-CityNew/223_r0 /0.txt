From this aerial view at 51 meters, I can see what appears to be a rooftop area with various structures. To conduct a thorough search for any anomalies, I'll first move towards the center of the image at (0, 17) and descend a bit to get a better view of that area, as it seems to have some interesting features that might be worth investigating.</Reasoning>
