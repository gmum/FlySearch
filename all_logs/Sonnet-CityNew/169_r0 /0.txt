<Reasoning>
From this aerial view at 52 meters, I can see a road network but no clear crowd yet. To effectively search for a crowd, I should:
1. Lower my altitude to get a better view
2. Move towards the center of the visible area to maximize my search coverage
3. From there, I can systematically scan the area

I'll move to coordinates (0,0) which is the center point, and simultaneously descend by 20 meters to get a better view while still maintaining enough height to scan a good area.</Reasoning>
