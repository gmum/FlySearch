<Reasoning>
I can now see what appears to be a crowd gathering in the lower right portion of the image, around coordinates (11, -11). I need to:
1. Move closer to that location
2. Further decrease my altitude to get below 10 meters as required
3. Center myself above the crowd

I'll move to those coordinates and descend by 23 meters, which will put me at 9 meters above ground level - perfect for the requirement of being below 10 meters.</Reasoning>
