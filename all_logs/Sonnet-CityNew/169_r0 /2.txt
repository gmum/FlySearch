<Reasoning>
I can now see a crowd directly in my field of view, and I am already at the optimal altitude of 9 meters, which satisfies the requirement of being below 10 meters. The crowd is centered in my view, and I can clearly observe them. All conditions are met:
1. Altitude is below 10 meters (currently at 9 meters)
2. The crowd is in my field of view
3. I am centered over the target
4. I can clearly see the crowd</Reasoning>
