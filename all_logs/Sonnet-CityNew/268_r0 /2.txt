I need to be more strategic. I can see a ladder in the alleyway between the buildings, which could be the anomalous object. However, I need to be careful with my descent due to the buildings. Let me move to position (25, -25) to get a better angle on the alley area, and make a smaller altitude adjustment of -15 meters to maintain safe clearance.</Reasoning>
