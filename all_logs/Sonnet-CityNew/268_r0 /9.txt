I apologize, but it seems I've reached my maximum number of allowed moves (9) and have been unable to safely reach the target position. The narrow urban environment with tall buildings has made it particularly challenging to navigate safely to get within 10 meters of the ladder while maintaining a clear view. I should have been more conservative with my initial movements and planned a better approach strategy.</Reasoning>
