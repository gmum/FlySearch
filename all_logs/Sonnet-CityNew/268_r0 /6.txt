I need to be much more cautious. From my current position at 74 meters, I can see the ladder in the alley below, but I've been having trouble navigating safely. Let me try moving to (0, 25) - a position that should give me a clearer view of the ladder area while staying at the current altitude. This should help me better assess how to safely get closer to the target.</Reasoning>
