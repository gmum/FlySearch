I've been making this too complicated. I can clearly see the ladder in the alley from my current position, but I need to get closer to it vertically while staying safe. Since moving horizontally keeps causing safety issues, I should stay in my current horizontal position and simply reduce altitude to get closer to the target. I'll descend by 65 meters, which should put me at about 9 meters above the ladder while maintaining my current horizontal position.</Reasoning>
