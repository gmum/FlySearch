I see I need to be more careful with my movements. I notice what appears to be a ladder or some kind of structure in the lower portion of the image. I'll move to position (0, -25) to get a better view of that area, and descend by a smaller amount of 20 meters this time to maintain safe clearance while getting a closer look.</Reasoning>
