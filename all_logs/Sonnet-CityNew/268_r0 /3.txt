<Reasoning>
I need to change my approach. Given the tall buildings and narrow alley, I should stay at a safer altitude and position myself better first. I can see what appears to be a ladder in the alley, but I need to be careful about my movements. Let me move to position (25, 0) without changing altitude to get a better view down the alley from a safer position.</Reasoning>
