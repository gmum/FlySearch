<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an intersection from above. While I don't immediately see a fire, there are some orange/reddish objects in the lower part of the image that I should investigate closer. I'll move towards that area (around -21 coordinates) and lower my altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
