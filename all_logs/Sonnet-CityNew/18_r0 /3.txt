FOUND

<Reasoning>I am now perfectly positioned to see the fire line on the ground. I am at 9 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and the fire is clearly visible in my field of view and I am centered over it. This meets all the requirements for declaring the fire as found.</Reasoning>
