<Reasoning>I can now see the intersection more clearly at 25 meters. I notice there's a well-lit crosswalk intersection, but I still need to get lower to properly spot any crowds. I'll maintain my horizontal position near the intersection but descend further to about 15 meters to get a better view of the street level.</Reasoning>
