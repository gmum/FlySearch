<Reasoning>I've now systematically searched the intersection area at a safe altitude below 10 meters, but I haven't found any crowds. I notice there might be some movement near (-5, -5), but I should remain within safe bounds. Since this is my last available move and I haven't found any definitive crowds, I'll check the southeastern corner of the intersection.</Reasoning>
