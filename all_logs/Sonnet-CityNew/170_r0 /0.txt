<Reasoning>I can see this is an urban environment with tall buildings and streets. Since I'm looking for a crowd and currently at 55 meters altitude, I should first get lower to have a better view of the street level where people would be. I notice there's better lighting and what appears to be a crosswalk area around coordinate (18, 0). I'll move there and descend to about 25 meters to get a better view while still maintaining enough height to scan the area.</Reasoning>
