<Reasoning>At 15 meters, I have a better view of the intersection, but I still don't see any crowds. I notice that I can see more details in the positive y direction (north). I'll move slightly north and continue descending to get an even closer look at the street level, aiming for about 8 meters altitude which will put me safely under the 10-meter requirement while maintaining visibility.</Reasoning>
