<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a yellow vehicle or object in the lower right portion of the image, around coordinates (21, -21). This stands out as potentially being the anomaly we're looking for. I'll move towards it and reduce altitude to get a better look and position myself within 10 meters of it.</Reasoning>
