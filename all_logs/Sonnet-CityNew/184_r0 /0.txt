<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a construction or dock area in the left portion of the image. I need to move toward the construction site and lower my altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (-31, 0) which will position me closer to the construction area, and I'll descend by 30 meters to get a better look.</Reasoning>
