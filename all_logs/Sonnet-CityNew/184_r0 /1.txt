<Reasoning>I can now see the road construction area more clearly in the lower left portion of the image. I need to move closer to that area and continue descending to get below 10 meters. I'll move to coordinates (-43, -21) to center on the construction area and descend by another 54 meters to get within the required altitude.</Reasoning>
