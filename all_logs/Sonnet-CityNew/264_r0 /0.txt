<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a yellow object in the northeastern part of the parking lot area (around coordinate (49, 0)). This could be the anomaly we're looking for since it stands out against the dark pavement. I'll move closer to that position and reduce altitude significantly to get a better look.</Reasoning>
