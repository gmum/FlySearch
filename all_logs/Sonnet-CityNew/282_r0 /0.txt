<Reasoning>I can see an aerial view of what appears to be an urban intersection. To begin the search for any anomalous objects, I'll first move to a more central position and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll aim for the intersection point (0, 0) and descend by 30 meters to get a clearer view of potential anomalies.</Reasoning>
