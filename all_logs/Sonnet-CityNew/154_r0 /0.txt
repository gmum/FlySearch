<Reasoning>I can see a parking lot and streets from this altitude, but I need to systematically search the area for the green pickup truck. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view of the vehicles in the area. I'll move towards (0,0) and descend by 20 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue the search effectively.</Reasoning>
