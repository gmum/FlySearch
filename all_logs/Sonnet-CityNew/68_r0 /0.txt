<Reasoning>I need to systematically search for the white sport car. From this aerial view at 72 meters, I can see several streets and buildings. I should first scan the visible roads since cars are typically found there. I notice I'm at a good vantage point to start a methodical search. I'll move towards (0, -24) to get a better view of the street area and lower my altitude to get a clearer view of vehicles.</Reasoning>
