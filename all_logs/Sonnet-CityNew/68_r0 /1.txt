<Reasoning>From this lower altitude of 42 meters, I can see more details but I don't spot the white sport car yet. I notice there's a street to the right side of the image that needs to be checked. I'll move towards (28, 0) to inspect that area and continue lowering my altitude for a better view.</Reasoning>
