<Reasoning>I can see several rooftops from this altitude. To conduct an effective search for anomalies, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while maintaining a position that gives me good visibility of the central area. I'll descend to about 60 meters while staying near the center position to maintain a good overview.</Reasoning>
