<Reasoning>
I've moved closer to where I thought I saw something green, but I don't see the green pickup truck in this area. I need to expand my search. From this position, I can see a road and some structures, but need to check other areas. Let's move back up slightly for a wider view and head towards the parking area I saw earlier, checking (-19, 0) coordinates.
