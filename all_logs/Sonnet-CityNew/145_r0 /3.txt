<Reasoning>
I can now clearly see the green pickup truck in my field of view at approximately (-5, -5). I am already below 10 meters altitude (at 8 meters) and the truck is centered in my view. This meets all the requirements: the object is in view, I'm below 10 meters altitude, and I'm centered on the target.
