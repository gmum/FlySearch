<Reasoning>
From this aerial view of an urban area at 69 meters altitude, I need to conduct a systematic search for any signs of fire. I notice several buildings and streets, but no immediate signs of fire. I should first try to get a lower altitude to better observe any potential smoke or flames, while maintaining a central position to maximize my field of view. I'll descend to about 40 meters first while staying in the center position to get a better overview.</Reasoning>
