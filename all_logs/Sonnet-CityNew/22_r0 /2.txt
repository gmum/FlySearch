I can now see what appears to be smoke or fire activity more clearly in the lower portion of the image, around coordinates (0, -13). I need to descend further to get within 10 meters of the target while staying centered on it. I'll maintain my horizontal position but decrease altitude to 8 meters to ensure I'm within the required range.</Reasoning>
