At 40 meters altitude, I have a clearer view but still no obvious signs of fire. However, I notice what appears to be some activity or potential smoke in the lower part of the image, around coordinates (0, -13). I should investigate this area more closely by moving slightly south and descending further to get a better look.</Reasoning>
