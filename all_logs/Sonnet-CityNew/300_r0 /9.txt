<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a red object that appears to be the anomaly I'm looking for. It's positioned near (0, 7). I need to get closer but still maintain a safe distance. I'll move to that position and descend slightly more to get within the required 10 meters while keeping it in view.</Reasoning>
