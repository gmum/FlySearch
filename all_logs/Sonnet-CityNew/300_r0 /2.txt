<Reasoning>I need to be more conservative with my movements. I can see a bright spot that could be the anomaly I'm looking for, but I need to stay at a safer distance. I'll move towards it but maintain my current altitude for now to better assess what I'm seeing. Moving to position (11, -21) to get a better view of that bright area.</Reasoning>
