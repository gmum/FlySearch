<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a red object or marking near coordinate (0, 0) that stands out from the surrounding environment. This could be the anomaly I'm looking for. I need to get closer but remain at a safe distance. I'll move back to the center position and carefully reduce altitude to get a better look.</Reasoning>
