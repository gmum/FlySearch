<Reasoning>Now I have a better view of the area. I can see what appears to be a rooftop or elevated structure with some architectural features. I notice something that might be unusual - there appears to be a vertical object or pole in the lower portion of the image. I'll move towards that area but maintain this safer altitude to investigate.</Reasoning>
