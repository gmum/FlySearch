<Reasoning>I see what appears to be a rooftop surface with some texture and spots. I need to be more careful with my descent to avoid collisions. I notice a bright spot in the lower portion of the image that could be an anomaly. I'll move slightly in that direction and descend at a more moderate rate to investigate it.</Reasoning>
