<Reasoning>
I see what appears to be some kind of unusual structure or anomaly in the lower portion of the image. The area appears to have some white and brown coloring that stands out. To investigate this better while maintaining safe distance, I'll move slightly towards (0, -13) and reduce altitude by another 20 meters to get a clearer view, but not too close to risk collision.
