<Reasoning>
From this aerial view at 60 meters, I can see an urban environment with buildings and streets. I notice a bright white spot in the lower left quadrant of the image that seems out of place compared to the surrounding area. To investigate this potential anomaly better, I should move closer to that location and reduce altitude to get a better view. I'll move towards coordinates (-20, -40) and decrease altitude by 30 meters.
