I keep getting emergency stops which indicates I'm not choosing safe paths. Let's try moving to a higher vantage point first to get a better overall view of the area. I'll move to (0, 26) and increase altitude by 20 meters to get a safer, broader perspective of the area before attempting to investigate further.
