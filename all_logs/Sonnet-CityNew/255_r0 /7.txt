I can now see a distinct white marking or object near (-20, -39) that stands out against the darker surroundings. This could be our anomaly. I'll move closer to that position and reduce altitude, but not too drastically to avoid another emergency stop. Moving to those coordinates and descending by 15 meters should give us a better view while maintaining safety.
