I need to adjust my approach. The previous attempts to get closer were too aggressive and risked collision. From this view at 39 meters, I can see some unusual lighting or reflective elements. Let's try a more conservative approach by moving to (0, 13) and reducing altitude by just 10 meters this time to maintain safer clearance while still investigating the anomaly.
