I need to rethink my strategy. The repeated emergency stops suggest I'm being too aggressive with altitude changes and movements. From this view, I can still see the bright area, but I need to maintain a safer distance. Let's try moving to (13, 0) while keeping the same altitude to get a different perspective before making any altitude adjustments.
