I can now clearly see the unusual crosswalk pattern that appears to be our target anomaly. I'm positioned at 9 meters above it, which is within our required range of being below 10 meters, and the object is centered in my field of view. This meets all the criteria - below 10 meters height, object in view, and centered position.
