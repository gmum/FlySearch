Now I can clearly see what appears to be our anomaly - there's a distinct crosswalk or road marking pattern that looks unusual compared to the regular street environment. It's in the center of the image, and since I'm at 44 meters, I need to get closer but carefully. I'll move to (0, 0) position to center directly over it and reduce altitude by 35 meters, which should put us under 10 meters above the object while maintaining a safe approach.
