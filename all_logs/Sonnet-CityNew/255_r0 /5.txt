<Reasoning>
Now I have a much clearer view of the area from this higher altitude. I can see cars and the street layout better. I notice something that might be unusual near the (-20, -39) coordinates in the lower portion of the image. I'll move in that direction while maintaining this safer altitude to investigate.
