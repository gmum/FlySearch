From this new view, I can see what appears to be a courtyard area with some distinct patterns on the ground. I notice something that looks unusual - there appears to be a lighter colored area or marking in the lower portion of the courtyard. I'll move to (0, -20) to get a better view of this area while maintaining the same altitude for now.
