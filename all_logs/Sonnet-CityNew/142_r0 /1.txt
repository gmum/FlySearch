<Reasoning>I apologize for the risky move. From this view, I can see the parking area more clearly. Since we're looking for a large trash pile and I don't see it in the immediate vicinity, I should move to explore a different area while maintaining a safer altitude. I'll move towards (22, 11) to check that section of the area.</Reasoning>
