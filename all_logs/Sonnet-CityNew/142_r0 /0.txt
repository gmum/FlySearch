<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a parking area with some cars, but no large trash pile is immediately visible. Given the height and angle, I should explore the area systematically. I'll move to a position that gives me a better view of the area while descending to get a closer look at the ground level. I'll head towards (0, -12) and descend by 15 meters to get a better view.</Reasoning>
