<Reasoning>I notice what appears to be a reddish-brown pile or cluster near the center of the parking area. This could be the trash pile we're looking for. I'll move closer to that position and decrease altitude to get a better look. Moving to (11, 0) and descending by 23 meters to get closer to the target while maintaining safe clearance.</Reasoning>
