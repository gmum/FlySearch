<Reasoning>Now I have a clearer view, but I still need to search for any anomalies. I can see the yellow taxi more clearly now, but as mentioned before, that's normal for this environment. I should continue investigating the area by going lower and slightly adjusting my position to get a better view of the street and surrounding area. I'll move towards (0, 0) and decrease altitude further.</Reasoning>
