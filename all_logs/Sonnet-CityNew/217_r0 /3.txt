<Reasoning>I can now see several metallic or gray objects on the ground, but there appears to be something that looks different in color (possibly greenish) near coordinates (21, 11). I'll move closer to that position and lower my altitude to inspect it better, as it seems to stand out from the other objects.</Reasoning>
