<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an urban environment with buildings and some equipment or installations on the ground. To begin my search for any anomalies, I'll move to a more central position at (0, 28) and lower my altitude by 30 meters to get a better view of the area. This will help me scan the environment more effectively while maintaining a safe distance from any structures.</Reasoning>
