<Reasoning>I apologize for the unsafe move. I can now see we're in a complex environment with overhead structures. I need to be more careful. I notice some objects on the ground in the lower portion of the image. I'll move to (0, -14) to get a better view of that area, and lower my altitude slightly to inspect what those objects might be while maintaining safe clearance from structures.</Reasoning>
