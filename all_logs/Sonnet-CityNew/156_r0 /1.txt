<Reasoning>I need to be more careful with altitude changes. Since we're at 21 meters now, I'll move systematically to scan the area. I notice some discoloration or potential debris in the northwest direction. I'll move towards (-7, 7) and reduce altitude by 10 meters to get a better look while maintaining safe clearance.</Reasoning>
