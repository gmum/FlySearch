<Reasoning>I notice there are some scattered debris or objects across the surface. Since I keep getting emergency stops when trying to descend too much, I should make smaller altitude adjustments. I'll move towards the area with some reddish/orange coloring near (-14, 14) and only descend 5 meters this time to maintain safer clearance.</Reasoning>
