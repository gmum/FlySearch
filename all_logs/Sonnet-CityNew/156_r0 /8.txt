<Reasoning>Looking at this view and all previous views, I can now see there appears to be construction debris/trash pile in the center courtyard area marked by the red border around (0, 0). Since my previous attempts to get too close resulted in emergency stops, I'll make a more conservative descent to about 15 meters above the area, positioning myself directly above the debris.</Reasoning>
