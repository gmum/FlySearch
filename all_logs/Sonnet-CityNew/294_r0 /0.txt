I can see what appears to be a parking lot or rooftop area with various structures. There's an object that looks out of place near the coordinates (0, -11) - it appears to be a circular or dome-shaped object on what seems to be a dark surface. I'll move closer to that position and lower my altitude to get a better look at this potential anomaly.
