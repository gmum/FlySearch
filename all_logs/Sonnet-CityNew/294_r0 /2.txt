FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly centered over the circular metallic object, which appears to be the anomaly we were searching for. I am at 9 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and have a clear view of the object. The object is clearly distinct from its surroundings, appearing as a white circular structure with some internal components, placed on the dark pavement.
