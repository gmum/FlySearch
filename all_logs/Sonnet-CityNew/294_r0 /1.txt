I can now clearly see the anomalous object - it appears to be a circular, metallic or reflective structure on the dark pavement. I am currently at 9 meters altitude, which is within the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view. I need to center myself better on the object, which appears to be around coordinates (3, 3).
