<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a white vehicle on the road near coordinates (0, -24). Since I need to get closer to confirm if this is our target and need to be below 10 meters from it, I'll move to those coordinates and decrease altitude by 62 meters to get to about 9 meters above the target.</Reasoning>
