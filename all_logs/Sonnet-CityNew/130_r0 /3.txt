I am now centered directly over the fire, which is clearly visible in my field of view. I am at 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters. The fire appears to be actively burning in the corner of the structure, with visible flames and smoke. All conditions for reporting the fire have been met: it's in view, I'm centered over it, and I'm at the correct altitude.
