<Reasoning>
From this aerial view of what appears to be a parking structure or covered area, I don't immediately see any fire. However, the area under the white beams/roof structure needs to be searched more thoroughly as fires could be less visible from this angle. I'll move to the center position and lower my altitude to get a better view underneath the structure.
