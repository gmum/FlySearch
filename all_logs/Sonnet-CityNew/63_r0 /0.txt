<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a road intersection with some vehicles. From this altitude and position, I should perform a systematic search starting with the area where there seems to be some vehicle activity. I'll move towards the road intersection at (-19, -19) and lower my altitude to get a better view of any potential police cars.</Reasoning>
