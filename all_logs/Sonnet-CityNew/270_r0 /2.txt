<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a white spherical object that appears to be the anomaly. I am currently at 9 meters altitude, which is within the required 10-meter range, and the object is centered in my field of view at my current position. This satisfies all the requirements - the object is in view, I'm centered on it, and I'm below 10 meters altitude.</Reasoning>
