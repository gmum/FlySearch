<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a white circular object near coordinate (0,0) that seems out of place compared to the rest of the urban environment. This could be our anomaly. I need to get closer and lower to confirm, but maintain it in my field of view. I'll move to position (0,0) and lower altitude by 33 meters to get within the required 10-meter range.</Reasoning>
