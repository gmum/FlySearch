<Reasoning>I need to perform a systematic search for any anomalies in the area. From this altitude and position, I can see a city street with buildings, water, and some vehicles. To get a better view of potential anomalies, I should first lower my altitude while moving slightly to scan the area. I'll move towards (0, 24) and decrease altitude by 30 meters to get a clearer view of that section.</Reasoning>
