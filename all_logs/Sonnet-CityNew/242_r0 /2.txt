<Reasoning>At 15 meters, I can now see some vehicles parked on the street and what appears to be a pedestrian or object near the intersection of the red structure and the street. This could be our anomaly. I'll move slightly closer to that position and lower my altitude to get within the required 10 meters.</Reasoning>
