<Reasoning>At 30 meters, I have a clearer view but still need to get lower. I notice something that looks like a red-tinted structure or walkway running diagonally through the image. I'll move slightly towards the area where this structure intersects with the darker pavement and continue descending to get a better look at any potential anomalies in this area.</Reasoning>
