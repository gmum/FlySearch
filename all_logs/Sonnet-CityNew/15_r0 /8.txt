<Reasoning>After multiple attempts, it's becoming clear that getting below 10 meters might not be safely possible in this urban environment with tall buildings and various obstacles. The road construction site is visible, but safety constraints are preventing the close approach required by the mission parameters. I should try one more position that looks to have clearer airspace, moving to (0, 10) with a small descent.</Reasoning>
