<Reasoning>Now I have a better view of the area. I can see the road construction site more clearly from this safer altitude. Since my previous attempts to get closer were unsuccessful, I should try moving to a different position where there might be fewer obstacles. I'll move to (0, 11) to get a different angle on the construction area.</Reasoning>
