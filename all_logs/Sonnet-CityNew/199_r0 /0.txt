<Reasoning>I can see a road intersection in the image, but no clear construction site yet. Since I need to search for road construction, I should first scan the visible area more thoroughly at a lower altitude to get a better view. I'll move to the west side of the image and descend by 30 meters to get a clearer view of the road area.</Reasoning>
