<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a yellow object (possibly a fire) near coordinates (0, -16). Since I need to get closer and lower to confirm, I'll move to those coordinates and reduce altitude to get a better view. I'll drop down to about 15 meters to get a clearer look while staying at a safe height initially.</Reasoning>
