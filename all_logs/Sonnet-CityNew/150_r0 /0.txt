<Reasoning>From this aerial view, I need to systematically search for the trash pile. I notice there's an open area in the lower portion of the image. I'll move towards the lower center coordinates and decrease altitude to get a better view of that area, as it seems like a likely location for a trash pile to be located.</Reasoning>
