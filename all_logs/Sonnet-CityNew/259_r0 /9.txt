<Reasoning>I have now used all my available moves and was unable to safely get within 10 meters of the anomalous object while maintaining the required safety parameters. The repeated safety stops suggest there were protective zones or obstacles that prevented close approach to the target. From this final position, I still have visual on the area but could not achieve the mission objective of getting below 10 meters above the object.</Reasoning>
