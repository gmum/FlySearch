<Reasoning>I notice that my attempts to get close to the object have been consistently triggering safety stops. This suggests there might be obstacles or safety zones I need to respect. From this new higher vantage point, I can see the layout better, but I've used up 8 of my 9 allowed moves. For my final move, I'll try to position myself at a safer distance where I can still observe the anomaly.</Reasoning>
