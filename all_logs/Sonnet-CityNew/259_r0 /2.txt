<Reasoning>I can see a distinct white object directly in the area. I need to get closer to it but must be more careful with my descent this time. I'll move to (0, -27) to center on it and descend by 32 meters, which should put me at around 9 meters above it - safely within the required 10-meter range while maintaining a safe distance.</Reasoning>
