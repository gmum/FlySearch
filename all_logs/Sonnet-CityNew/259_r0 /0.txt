<Reasoning>I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. From this height, I can see what appears to be a parking lot or empty space in the lower left quadrant of the image. I'll move towards that area and lower my altitude to get a better view, as anomalous objects might be more visible in open spaces. I'll move to coordinates (-32, -32) and descend by 40 meters to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
