<Reasoning>I need to revise my approach. It seems moving directly to the object's position is causing safety issues. Instead, I'll move to (0, -14), which is halfway between my current position and the object, and descend by just 10 meters. This should give me a better view while maintaining a safer distance.</Reasoning>
