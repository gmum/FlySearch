<Reasoning>I need to be more cautious with my descent. The white object is clearly visible, and I need to get within 10 meters of it while staying safe. I'll move to (0, -27) to center on it, but this time I'll descend by just 15 meters first to get a better sense of the safe approach distance.</Reasoning>
