I need to rethink my approach. I can see the orange/tan anomaly clearly at (0, -19), but my previous descent attempts have been too aggressive. Given that I keep getting emergency stops, I should make a much smaller altitude adjustment while maintaining the same horizontal position. I'll try a more conservative 10-meter descent this time.
