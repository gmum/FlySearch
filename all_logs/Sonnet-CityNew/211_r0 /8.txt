<Reasoning>
From this position, I can no longer see the orange anomaly - I appear to have moved to a position where the view is blocked by the building's exterior wall. I need to return to my previous position where I could clearly see the target. I'll move back to (0, 0) to regain visual contact with the anomaly.
