I appear to be encountering a limitation where I cannot descend directly over the anomaly, possibly due to structural constraints or safety parameters. Let me try a different approach - I'll move to a position slightly forward of the anomaly at (0, -10) first, maintaining the current altitude, and then reassess the situation from there.
