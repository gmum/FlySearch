I appear to be in a situation where I've lost visual contact with the anomaly and am now facing a wall. After multiple attempts, I've been unable to get close enough to the target while maintaining a safe distance from structures. Additionally, I've used up my 9 allowed moves without successfully completing the mission. The challenge appears to be that the structural constraints of the building are preventing safe approach to get within 10 meters of the target while maintaining visual contact.
