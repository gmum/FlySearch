<Reasoning>
From this new position at 60 meters, I can see several parked cars and what appears to be some architectural features. I notice something that might be unusual in the lower portion of the image - there seems to be an orange/tan colored area that stands out from the regular pattern of the structure. I'll move towards (-20, -40) to investigate this area more closely and reduce altitude by another 30 meters to get a better look.
