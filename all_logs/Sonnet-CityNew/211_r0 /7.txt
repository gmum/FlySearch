From this higher vantage point, I can see that I need to approach this differently. Instead of trying to get directly above the anomaly, I should try to observe it from a position where I can maintain a safe distance from the structures. I'll move to (0, -45) which should give me a view of the anomaly from a safer angle, and maintain this altitude for now.
