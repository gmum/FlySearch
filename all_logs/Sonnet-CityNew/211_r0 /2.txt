I apologize for the previous risky move. I can now see more clearly that there's an orange/tan colored anomaly in the architectural pattern, located around (0, -19). This appears to be our target object as it clearly stands out from the surrounding gray structure. I'll move to center on it and carefully reduce altitude to get within 10 meters of it, but being more cautious this time with the descent.
