From this aerial view at 90 meters, I notice what appears to be a large open area with some buildings and structures. To begin an efficient search pattern, I'll start by moving to a more central position and reducing altitude to get a better view of any potential anomalies. I'll move towards (0, 0) and descend by 30 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to keep a good field of vision.
