I need to be more careful with my descent rate. The orange/tan anomaly is clearly visible at coordinates (0, -19), but I need to approach it more gradually. Instead of making a large altitude change, I'll make a smaller descent of 20 meters while maintaining the same horizontal position. This should help avoid any potential collisions while still getting closer to our target.
