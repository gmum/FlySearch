<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small yellow/orange spot near the center of the image that could potentially be a fire. Since I need to get closer to confirm and need to be below 10 meters to mark it as found, I'll move directly to that position and significantly reduce altitude to about 8 meters to ensure I'm within the required range.</Reasoning>
