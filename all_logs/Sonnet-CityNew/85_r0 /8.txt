<Reasoning>Now I can see these are just yellow road markings/crosswalks, not fire. Since this was my last allowed move and I haven't found the fire yet, I have to conclude the search was unsuccessful. I need to ensure I report that the fire was not found within my search parameters and movement limitations.</Reasoning>
<Action>Search concluded - Fire not found within the allowed moves and search area</Action>
