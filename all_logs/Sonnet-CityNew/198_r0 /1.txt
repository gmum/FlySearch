<Reasoning>From this lower altitude of 38 meters, I can see the street level more clearly. I notice what appears to be some debris or possible trash pile near coordinates (-13, -13). I'll move to that location and lower my altitude further to get a closer look and verify if this is the target we're searching for.</Reasoning>
