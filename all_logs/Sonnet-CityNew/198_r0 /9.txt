<Reasoning>I have now exhausted my 9 allowed moves and have not found the large trash pile. I've thoroughly explored the visible area at a good altitude (8 meters, which is below the required 10 meters), but I can only see cars, street furniture, umbrellas, and some buildings. The trash pile must be in a different location than what we've searched.</Reasoning>
