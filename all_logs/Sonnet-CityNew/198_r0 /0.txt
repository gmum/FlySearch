<Reasoning>I can see an urban environment from a high altitude of 88 meters. To effectively search for a trash pile, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view of the ground level. Looking at the image, there's a clearer area around coordinate (0, -29) that might be worth investigating. I'll move there and decrease altitude significantly to get a better view of any potential trash piles.</Reasoning>
