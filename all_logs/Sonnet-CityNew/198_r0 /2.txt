<Reasoning>I can see the ground much more clearly now at 18 meters altitude. I notice what appears to be a collection of items near (-6, -6). I'll move closer to that location and decrease my altitude to get below 10 meters as required by the mission parameters. This should give me a clear view to confirm if this is the trash pile we're looking for.</Reasoning>
