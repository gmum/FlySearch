<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be some road markings or construction patterns at the intersection in the center of the image. To get a better view and verify if this is the construction site I'm looking for, I should move closer to the center intersection and significantly reduce altitude to get under 10 meters as required. I'll move to coordinates (0,0) and descend by 45 meters, which will put me at around 8 meters altitude - well within the required range.</Reasoning>
