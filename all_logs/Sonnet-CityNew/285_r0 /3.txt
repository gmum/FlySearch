<Reasoning>I can now clearly see an anomalous object - what appears to be a bench with an unusual dark extension or shadow. I am positioned well to observe it and am already at a good altitude (9 meters), which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters. The object is clearly in my field of view and I am centered well enough to make the call.</Reasoning>
