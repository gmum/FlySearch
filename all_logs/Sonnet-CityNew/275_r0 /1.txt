From this lower altitude, I can see more details of the street. I notice something that might be unusual near the center of the intersection. To get a better look and confirm if it's the anomaly we're searching for, I'll descend further while staying centered. I'll reduce altitude by another 30 meters to get much closer to ground level while maintaining my position over the center point.</Reasoning>
