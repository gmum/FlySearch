From this aerial view of what appears to be a city intersection, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies. The view shows several buildings and a street intersection. To get a better look at the ground level where anomalies might be more visible, I should first reduce altitude while staying near the center point. I'll move to (0,0) coordinates and decrease altitude by 40 meters to get a clearer view of the street level while maintaining enough height to keep a good field of view.</Reasoning>
