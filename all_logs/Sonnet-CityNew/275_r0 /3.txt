<Reasoning>
I can now clearly see what appears to be an anomalous marking or object on the street near the crosswalk. I am currently at 9 meters altitude, which is within the required 10-meter threshold, and the object is centered in my field of view. This position meets all the requirements - below 10 meters height, centered on the object, and the object is clearly visible.</Reasoning>
