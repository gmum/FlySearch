I can now see what appears to be an anomaly near the bottom of the image - there seems to be something unusual in the street near the crosswalk. Since I need to be centered on the object and below 10 meters to properly identify it, I'll move slightly south (towards the object) and descend just a bit more to get within the required 10-meter height requirement while keeping the object in view.</Reasoning>
