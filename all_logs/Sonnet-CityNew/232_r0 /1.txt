<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be an anomalous dark object on the rooftop that looks out of place compared to the surrounding area. It's slightly south of my current position. I'll move towards it (around coordinates 0,-12) and lower my altitude significantly to get closer to it, ensuring I'll be within 10 meters of it.</Reasoning>
