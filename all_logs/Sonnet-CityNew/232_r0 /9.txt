<Reasoning>I've used several moves and keep encountering safety stops. Given that we need to find an anomaly and get below 10 meters, but all my descent attempts are being blocked by safety measures, I must conclude that either:
1. The safety system is preventing me from getting close enough to complete the mission
2. I'm not approaching the actual anomaly from the correct position
3. My descent attempts have been too aggressive

Let me try one final careful approach by moving slightly west to get a better view of the area while maintaining altitude.</Reasoning>
