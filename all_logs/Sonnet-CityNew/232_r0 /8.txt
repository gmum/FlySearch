<Reasoning>From this higher vantage point, I can now see several dark objects that appear to be ventilation structures on the roof. One of these must be the anomaly I'm looking for. Since I've used several moves already and need to get below 10 meters, I'll try approaching the object near (7,0) from a higher altitude, which might give me more room to maneuver safely.</Reasoning>
