<Reasoning>I can now see a circular object in the pavement near coordinates (3, -3) that appears to be unusual and doesn't fit with the rest of the environment. It looks like some kind of metal cover or marking that stands out from the regular road surface. I'll move directly above it while maintaining this low altitude to confirm.</Reasoning>
