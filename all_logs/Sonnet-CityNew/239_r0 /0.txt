<Reasoning>I can see an urban environment with tall buildings and streets. From this height, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies. I notice there's a yellow object near the (0, 27) coordinates that might be worth investigating. I'll move closer to that position and reduce altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
