<Reasoning>From this aerial view, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies. I notice some vehicles and buildings, but I should get a closer look at the area around the intersection and the plaza/courtyard area to the west where there appear to be some structures. I'll move to a central position and lower my altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
