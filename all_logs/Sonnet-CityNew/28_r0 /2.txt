<Reasoning>I can now see the area much more clearly, but I don't see any obvious trash pile in this immediate view. I should explore the more eastern portion of this brown area where there appears to be some darker patches. I'll move to (4, 4) to investigate that section while maintaining this low altitude.</Reasoning>
