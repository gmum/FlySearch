<Reasoning>I can see an urban environment from above, with buildings, streets, and what appears to be an empty lot or brown area in the lower portion of the image. Since I'm looking for a large trash pile, that brown area near coordinates (-16, -16) looks promising as it's an open space that could contain what we're looking for. I'll move closer to that area and reduce altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
