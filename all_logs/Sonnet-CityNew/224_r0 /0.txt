From this aerial view at 46 meters, I can see a parking lot area with several cars and street markings. To begin my search for any anomalies, I'll first lower my altitude to get a better view of the area while moving towards the center of the visible area. I'll choose coordinates (15, 0) and reduce altitude by 20 meters to get a closer look at the central area.
