At this lower altitude, I can now see a small circular object or marking in the parking space at approximately coordinates (7, -3). It appears to be different from the regular parking lot markings and could be our target anomaly. I'll move directly above it and lower my altitude slightly to get within the required 10 meters while keeping it in view.
