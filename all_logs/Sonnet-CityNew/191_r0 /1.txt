I notice some dark spots in the parking area, but I need to get closer to determine if any of them might be a fire. I'll continue to reduce altitude and move slightly towards the center row of parking spaces where I see some potential areas of interest around (0,0). Getting lower will help me better identify if there are any signs of fire.</Reasoning>
