<Reasoning>Still no sign of the blue sports car in this area. I need to return to where I first spotted the blue car in the initial view. I'll move back towards the original parking area where there were more cars visible. I'll keep the same altitude for now as it provides a good balance between overview and detail.</Reasoning>
