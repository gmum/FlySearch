<Reasoning>I have now exhausted all my allowed moves and was unable to locate the blue sports car. My movements were not optimal, and I should have maintained better tracking of where I first spotted the blue car. Additionally, I encountered several safety stops due to getting too close to objects. For safety reasons and since I'm out of moves, I must conclude the search without finding the target vehicle.</Reasoning>
