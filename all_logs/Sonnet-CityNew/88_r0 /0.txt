<Reasoning>I can see several cars in the parking lot. I notice there's a blue car in the upper row. To get a better view and confirm if it's the target vehicle, I should move closer to that area and lower my altitude. I'll move towards the coordinates near the blue car I spotted and descend to get a clearer view.</Reasoning>
