<Reasoning>I need to systematically search the area for a large trash pile. From my current altitude of 34 meters, I can see a good portion of the area, but I need to get lower to better identify objects. I'll start by moving towards the center-right area (11, 0) and descending to get a better view, as this area seems to have some potential objects that need closer inspection.</Reasoning>
