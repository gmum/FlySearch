<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a pile of debris/trash in my field of view, but I need to get a bit lower to ensure I'm within 10 meters of it as required by the objective. The pile appears to be centered around (-5, 0). I'll move slightly to better center on it and descend to about 8 meters altitude to ensure I'm meeting the requirement of being below 10 meters.</Reasoning>
