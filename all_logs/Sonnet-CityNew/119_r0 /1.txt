From this new position at 38 meters, I can see what appears to be some discoloration or debris on the surface in the lower portion of the image. To get a clearer view and ensure I'm within 10 meters of the potential trash pile, I should move towards (0, -25) and reduce my altitude further. This will help me confirm if this is the target I'm looking for while staying within the required altitude parameters.</Reasoning>
