I notice that my previous attempts to move closer to the trash pile have triggered safety stops. This suggests there might be obstacles or safety concerns with moving too close or too low. Since I can clearly see the trash pile from my current position, and changing position or altitude seems risky, I should evaluate if my current position meets the requirements. At 30 meters altitude, I'm still too high to meet the "below 10 meters" requirement. Let me try a very small, careful descent while staying in the same horizontal position.</Reasoning>
