From this new position, I'm seeing mostly buildings, streets, and parking areas, but no clear signs of a large trash pile. The previous area where I saw the debris pattern on what appeared to be a rooftop might have been my best opportunity, but I was unable to safely get below 10 meters there. Let me try one more area to the southwest to complete my search pattern.</Reasoning>
