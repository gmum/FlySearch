<Reasoning>
After a complete search pattern and using all available moves, I was unable to successfully complete the mission. The main challenge was that when I found what appeared to be the trash pile (on what seemed to be a rooftop), the safety systems prevented getting below 30 meters altitude. This suggests either:
1. The target was on an elevated surface where close approach wasn't safe
2. We need to search in a different area
3. There might be obstacles or safety concerns preventing low-altitude approaches in this urban environment

Without being able to get below 10 meters while keeping the target in view, I cannot declare "FOUND" as it would not meet the mission parameters.</Reasoning>
