From this aerial view at 88 meters, I notice an area in the lower portion of the image that might contain what appears to be a pile of debris or trash. To get a better view and confirm, I should move towards coordinates (-29, -29) and lower my altitude significantly to get closer to the potential target area. This will help me verify if this is indeed the trash pile I'm looking for.</Reasoning>
