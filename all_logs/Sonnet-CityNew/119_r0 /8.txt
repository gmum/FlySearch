After exploring multiple areas, I've encountered several challenges:
1. The most promising area with debris/trash appeared to be on what might be a rooftop, where safety systems prevented getting below 30 meters
2. Other areas explored showed mostly buildings, streets, and infrastructure
3. I've now used all my available moves without finding a location where I could safely get below 10 meters of the target

Unfortunately, I was unable to successfully complete the mission parameters of getting below 10 meters of the trash pile while keeping it in view. This might indicate that the trash pile is either on an elevated surface (like a roof) where close approach is not safe, or that we need to search in a different area altogether.</Reasoning>
