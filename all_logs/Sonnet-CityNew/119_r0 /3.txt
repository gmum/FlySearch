I need to be more careful with altitude changes. I can see the trash/debris area in the lower portion of the image. To safely observe it while staying within our parameters, I'll move to (0, -20) and make a smaller altitude adjustment to 15 meters. This will keep us at a safer height while getting closer to our target.</Reasoning>
