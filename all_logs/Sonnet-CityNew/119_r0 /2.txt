I apologize for the previous risky move. From this position at 30 meters, I can see what appears to be a collection of debris or trash in the lower portion of the image. To safely get a closer look while maintaining a safe distance, I'll move to (0, -10) and reduce my altitude by 21 meters, which will put me at 9 meters above the target - within our required range of under 10 meters but still maintaining safe clearance.</Reasoning>
