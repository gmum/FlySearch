I can see an aerial view of an urban area with roads and buildings. Since I'm looking for a fire and need to conduct a thorough search, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while maintaining a good search coverage. I'll move towards the center-south area (-28, -28) and decrease altitude by 30 meters to better spot any signs of fire.
