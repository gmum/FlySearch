<Reasoning>I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. From this aerial view at night, I can see a parking lot and building area. I should first descend to get a better view while moving towards the center of the image where there appears to be more open space. I'll maintain my horizontal position but reduce altitude significantly to better spot any potential trash piles.</Reasoning>
