From this aerial view, I need to systematically search for the trash pile. I notice we're quite high up at 58 meters, and the view shows what appears to be an urban area with buildings and streets. I should first move to a lower altitude to get a better view while maintaining a position that gives me good visibility of the area. I'll move down by 30 meters to get a clearer view of the ground level, while moving slightly towards the center-south area (0, -19) where there seems to be more open space to search.
