Now I have a clearer view at 28 meters altitude. I can see some cars and urban features, but I need to continue searching for the trash pile. I notice something that might be of interest in the upper left area around (-19, 19) where there appears to be some darker objects clustered together. I'll move in that direction and lower the altitude further to get a better look, going down another 15 meters to get closer to the target height of under 10 meters.
