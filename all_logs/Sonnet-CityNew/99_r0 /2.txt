I can now see what appears to be the target - there's a circular arrangement of what looks like debris or trash items near the center of the view (around 0, 0). I'm currently at 13 meters altitude, which is still too high according to the objective (needs to be below 10 meters). I'll maintain my horizontal position but descend another 5 meters to get below the 10-meter requirement while keeping the target centered in my view.
