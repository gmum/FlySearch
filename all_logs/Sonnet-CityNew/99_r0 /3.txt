Perfect! I have found the trash pile arranged in a circular pattern, and I am now at 8 meters altitude, which satisfies the requirement of being below 10 meters. The target is clearly in my field of view and centered in the image. Since all conditions are met (below 10m altitude, target centered and in view), I can confirm the find.
