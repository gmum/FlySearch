<Reasoning>I can see an intersection with crosswalks from above. I should start by getting lower to have a better view of the area and moving slightly towards the center of the intersection where the crosswalks meet. This will give me a better vantage point to spot any anomalies. I'll aim for the (0, 18) coordinate and reduce altitude by 30 meters.</Reasoning>
