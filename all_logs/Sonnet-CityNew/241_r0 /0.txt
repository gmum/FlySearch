<Reasoning>I'm looking at an aerial view of what appears to be a city intersection from quite high up (82 meters). To effectively search for any anomalies, I should first get lower to have a better view of the area. I'll move to the center coordinates and decrease altitude significantly to get a better view of the street level where anomalies are more likely to be visible.</Reasoning>
