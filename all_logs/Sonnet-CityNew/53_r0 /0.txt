<Reasoning>From this high aerial view of what appears to be a port or industrial area with roads and water, I can't clearly see any large trash pile. I need to lower my altitude significantly to get a better view of the area. I'll move towards the center of the visible area and descend by 40 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively.</Reasoning>
