<Reasoning>At this lower altitude, I can see more details of the area, but I still don't see any clear trash pile. I notice what might be some debris or objects near the waterfront on the right side of the image. I'll move slightly towards that area (positive x) and continue descending to get an even clearer view.</Reasoning>
