<Reasoning>I need to conduct a systematic search for the white pickup truck. From this aerial view at 47 meters, I can see an intersection with several vehicles, but I need to get lower to better identify specific vehicles. I'll start by moving to a central position and decreasing altitude to get a better view of the vehicles in the area.</Reasoning>
