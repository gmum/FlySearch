<Reasoning>At this lower altitude of 17 meters, I have a clearer view of the intersection. I can see several vehicles but don't spot a white pickup truck in the immediate vicinity. I'll move to the north direction where there appears to be more vehicles and maintain this lower altitude to continue the search.</Reasoning>
