I can see I'm now in a narrow space between buildings with what appears to be the fire at this location. I'm at 9 meters altitude which is within the required 10-meter range from the target, and I have confirmed visual contact with what appears to be the fire. Since I've met all the criteria - being centered on the target, being below 10 meters, and having visual confirmation - I've already declared "FOUND" and should maintain this position.
