I need to reconsider my approach. There are too many obstacles in this area. I should move to a safer position with better visibility. I'll move to (7, 7) which appears to have fewer obstacles, while maintaining the current altitude. From there, I can better assess how to safely approach the area where I spotted the potential fire.
