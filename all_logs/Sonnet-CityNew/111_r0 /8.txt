From this position, I can clearly see what appears to be a fire/glow at (0, -27) at the bottom of the image. Now that I have a clear line of sight and better understanding of the obstacles, I'll move to center over it while reducing altitude, but being careful not to go too low given the previous encounters with obstacles. I'll descend to about 9 meters to get within the required 10-meter range while maintaining safe clearance.
