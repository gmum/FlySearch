I see what appears to be smoke or a glow at the bottom of the image near (0, -13). I need to be careful not to get too close to the structures, especially the pipes visible in the image. I'll move towards the potential fire location but maintain a safer altitude of about 15 meters to avoid collisions with infrastructure.
