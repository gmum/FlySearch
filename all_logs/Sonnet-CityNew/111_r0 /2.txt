Now at 24 meters altitude, I can see the rooftop area more clearly. I notice what appears to be darker areas near (8, -8). I should move closer to that position and reduce altitude further to investigate if this could be the fire or fire damage. I'll move there and drop down to about 8 meters to get a very close look.
