I apologize, but I seem to be having difficulty safely reaching the required altitude while maintaining visual contact with the trash pile. I've used several moves already and each attempt to get closer has resulted in safety stops. Given that I cannot safely get below 10 meters while maintaining visual contact with the target, I should acknowledge that I cannot complete this mission within the given safety parameters.

Let me back away one final time to a safer position.
