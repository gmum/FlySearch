Now I have a much better view of the trash pile from a safer altitude. The pile is clearly visible near the center of the image. From this height of 40 meters, I need to get closer but must be more careful with my descent. I'll stay at (0, 0) to remain centered over the pile, and make a more conservative descent of 31 meters, which should put me at 9 meters above the pile - within our target range but still maintaining safe clearance.
