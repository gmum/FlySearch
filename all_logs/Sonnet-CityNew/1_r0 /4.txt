I can now clearly see what appears to be the trash pile made up of various debris and materials on the concrete surface. I need to get closer to it while maintaining a safe approach. I'll position myself directly above it at (0, -12) where the pile is centered, and descend to get within 10 meters as required, but not too close to risk hitting anything. I'll descend by 27 meters to get to approximately 8 meters above the pile.
