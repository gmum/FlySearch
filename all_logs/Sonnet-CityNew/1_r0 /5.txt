I apologize for the unsafe descent. I need to be more cautious with altitude changes. From this position, I can see I need to back away to get a better overall view. I'll move to (0, -19) to maintain a safer distance while still keeping the area of interest in view, and I'll only make a small altitude adjustment of -8 meters this time.
