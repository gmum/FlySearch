I can now see the trash pile clearly at the bottom portion of the image. I need to position myself directly above it at (0, -27). Given my previous failed attempts at getting too close, I'll make a more conservative descent this time, trying to get just under 10 meters while maintaining safety. From 40 meters, I'll descend by 31 meters, which should put me at approximately 9 meters above the pile.
