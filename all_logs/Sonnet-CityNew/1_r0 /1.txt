I don't see the trash pile in this view, and it appears I'm looking at a concrete surface. I need to adjust my position to search other areas. From my initial view, there might have been something interesting near (-49, -49), which is towards the bottom left corner of the original view. I'll move there while maintaining my current altitude to continue the search.
