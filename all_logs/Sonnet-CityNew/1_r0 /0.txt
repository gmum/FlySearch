From this aerial view at 73 meters, I can see what appears to be a construction or waste area in the bottom left quadrant of the image. I'll move towards that location and lower my altitude to get a better view of what might be a trash pile. I'll aim for coordinates (-49, -24) to investigate this area more closely, and I'll descend by 40 meters to get a better look.
