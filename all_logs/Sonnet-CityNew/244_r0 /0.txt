From this aerial view at 92 meters, I can see a rooftop with some structures on it. To begin my search for anomalies, I'll move to a central position (0, 0) and descend significantly to get a better view of any potential objects that don't belong. This will give me a better vantage point to spot anything unusual while maintaining a good field of view of the rooftop area.
