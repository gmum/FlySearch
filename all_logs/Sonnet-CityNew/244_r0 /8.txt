I've been getting emergency stops for all movements, which suggests there might be invisible obstacles or restrictions I'm not aware of. Since I need to get below 10 meters to complete the task but haven't been able to safely navigate closer, I should try a different approach. Looking at the image again, I can see what appears to be an anomalous dark spot near (11, -23). I'll try one final small movement to investigate.
