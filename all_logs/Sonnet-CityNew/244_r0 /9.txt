I've used all my allowed moves and have been unable to safely navigate closer to any of the potential anomalies I've spotted. The emergency stops suggest there might be safety constraints or invisible obstacles preventing both horizontal movements and altitude changes. I was unable to get below 10 meters as required to complete the task successfully. I'll have to end the mission without finding the object at the required proximity and altitude.
