<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be some road work or construction on the street below. I'll move towards the center of the image where I can see some lighter colored pavement that might indicate construction work, and lower my altitude to get a better look. I'll aim for coordinates (0,0) which is the center of the grid and reduce altitude by 42 meters to get closer to the required height of under 10 meters.</Reasoning>
