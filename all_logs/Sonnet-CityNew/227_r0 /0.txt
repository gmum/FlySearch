<Reasoning>
From this high altitude of 55 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. I notice the image shows an urban environment with buildings and parking areas. To get a better view of potential anomalies, I should first lower my altitude while staying roughly in the center of the visible area. This will give me a better view of any unusual objects while maintaining good coverage of the search area. I'll move to coordinates (0,0) which is the center point and lower my altitude by 25 meters.</Reasoning>
