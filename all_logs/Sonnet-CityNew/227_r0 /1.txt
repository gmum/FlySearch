Now at 30 meters, I have a clearer view but I notice something interesting in the lower portion of the image where there appears to be some structures or objects. I should investigate the area around (0, -20) and lower my altitude further to get a better look at what might be there. This will help me determine if there's anything anomalous in that section.</Reasoning>
