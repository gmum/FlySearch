<Reasoning>From this aerial view of what appears to be a city street with buildings and vehicles, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies. The image shows cars parked along what seems to be a street between buildings. To get a better view of potential anomalies at ground level, I should first lower my altitude while staying roughly in the center of the visible area. This will give me a closer look at the street and any potential objects that might stand out.</Reasoning>
