<Reasoning>At this lower altitude, I can see some white markings on the street that look like "T" shapes. There's also a yellow taxi visible. However, I should check the other areas of the street for any anomalies. I'll move slightly north to inspect that area while maintaining this low altitude, as it seems there might be something interesting near the top of the current view.</Reasoning>
