<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see more details of the hexagonal structure which appears to be a rooftop. I notice some objects scattered across it, and near (0, -18) there appears to be something that looks different from the regular pattern of objects. I'll move closer to that position and descend further to get a better look.</Reasoning>
