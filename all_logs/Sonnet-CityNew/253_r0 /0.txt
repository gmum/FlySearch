<Reasoning>I need to methodically search the area for any anomalies. From this aerial view, I can see several buildings, rooftops, and a street. I should start by getting lower to have a better view of the area, while moving towards the center of my visible area where I can then conduct a more detailed search. I'll move to coordinates (15, 0) and decrease altitude by 20 meters to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
