I need to perform a systematic search of the area. From my current altitude of 67 meters, I can see a large plaza or open space. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of potential anomalies. Moving to coordinates (0, 0) and descending by 30 meters will give me a better vantage point while maintaining enough height to scan the area effectively.
