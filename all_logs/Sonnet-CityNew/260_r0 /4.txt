I can now clearly see what appears to be the anomaly - a pickup truck that stands out from the environment. I am currently at 7 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and I am centered well enough to have a clear view of the object. This meets all the criteria: the object is in my field of view, I am below 10 meters altitude, and I am centered on the target.
