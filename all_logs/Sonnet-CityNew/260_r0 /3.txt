From this position, I can see what appears to be a vehicle or object that looks different from its surroundings near coordinates (7, 0). I'll move closer to that position and lower my altitude to investigate if this is the anomaly we're looking for. I need to get below 10 meters to confirm, but I'll do it carefully to avoid any obstacles.
