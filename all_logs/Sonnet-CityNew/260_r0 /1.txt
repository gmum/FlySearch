From this new position at 37 meters, I can see parked vehicles and the plaza more clearly. I notice what appears to be a street with some vehicles. I should continue my systematic search by moving towards the north (positive y direction) where there seems to be more activity, and lower my altitude further to get a closer look at any potential anomalies.
