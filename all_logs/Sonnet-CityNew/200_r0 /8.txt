I can now clearly see a police car at the bottom of the image. I am:
1. At 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters
2. The police car is in my field of view
3. I'm positioned appropriately above the target

Since all conditions are met - below 10m, centered, and target in view - I can confirm the find.
