I need to adjust my strategy. I'm still too aggressive with altitude changes. Let me try a more conservative approach:
1. Make smaller altitude changes
2. Move towards the light-colored area in the bottom of the image
3. Keep a safer distance while investigating

I'll move south with a smaller altitude decrease this time.
