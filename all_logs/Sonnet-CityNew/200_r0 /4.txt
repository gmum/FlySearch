I keep hitting safety barriers at this altitude. This suggests I need to:
1. Stay at current altitude or even go slightly higher to clear any obstacles
2. Then try to get a better view of the area
3. Move north to explore another section since I can't seem to go south or east safely

I'll move north while maintaining the same altitude to try a different search area.
