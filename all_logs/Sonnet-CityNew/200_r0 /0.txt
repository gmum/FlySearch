I can see what appears to be a main road running through the center of the image. To effectively search for a police car, I should:
1. Lower my altitude to get a better view
2. Move towards the main road where vehicles are likely to be
3. Search systematically along the road

I'll start by moving to the center of the road and lowering my altitude significantly to get a better view of any vehicles.
