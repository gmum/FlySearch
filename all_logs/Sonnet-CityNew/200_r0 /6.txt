Now I have a much better view! I can see the street clearly and I notice what appears to be a police car on the left side of the road. I should:
1. Move towards the left side of the street
2. Then gradually decrease altitude once I'm positioned above it
3. Make sure to stay centered on the target

I'll move to the left where I spotted what looks like a police vehicle.
