I apologize for the aggressive descent. Let me be more careful. I can see a road below, and I should search it systematically but at a safer altitude change rate. I notice something light-colored in the bottom of the image - I should investigate that area but approach more gradually. I'll move slightly south and reduce altitude by a smaller increment.
