I can now see a police car more clearly on the street. To properly complete the objective, I need to:
1. Get closer to the target by descending
2. Make sure I'm centered above it
3. Get to an altitude below 10 meters relative to the target

I'll descend while maintaining my position above the police car. I'll make a significant but careful descent since I'm currently quite high.
