<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be road construction work near the center of the image. To get a better view and comply with the requirement of being below 10 meters above the object, I'll move to coordinates (0, 12) where the yellow construction appears to be, and descend to about 8 meters altitude. This will position me directly above the construction site at a safe but close distance.</Reasoning>
