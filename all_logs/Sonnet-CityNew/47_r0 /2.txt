<Reasoning>I'm now at a much lower altitude (13 meters) and getting a clearer view of the area. I can see a parked car, but I should continue searching to the west where there appears to be more ground area visible. I'll move slightly west while maintaining this low altitude to investigate what appears to be some irregular shapes on the ground.</Reasoning>
