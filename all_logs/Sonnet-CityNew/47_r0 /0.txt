<Reasoning>From this aerial view at 63 meters, I can see a road along the waterfront but no clear trash pile yet. I should conduct a systematic search by moving to a different position and lowering my altitude to get a better view. I'll move towards the south and east section of the visible area while descending to get a clearer view of any potential trash piles.</Reasoning>
