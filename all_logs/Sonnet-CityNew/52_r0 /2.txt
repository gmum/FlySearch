<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a fire on the ground, and I'm properly centered above it at a height of 10 meters. The fire appears to be some kind of controlled burn or small fire on the street. Since I'm already at 10 meters altitude and centered on the fire, this meets our criteria of being at or below 10 meters and having the target in view.</Reasoning>
