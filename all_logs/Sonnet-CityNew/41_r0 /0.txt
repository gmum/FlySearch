<Reasoning>I need to perform a systematic search for a crowd. From my current altitude of 54 meters, I can see a large area but need to get closer to identify potential gatherings. I'll start by moving towards the (-36, 0) area which appears to have some open space and parking lots where people might gather, while also descending to get a better view.</Reasoning>
