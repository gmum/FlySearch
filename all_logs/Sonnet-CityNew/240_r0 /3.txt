<Reasoning>
I am now at 8 meters altitude and have a clear view of the red cylindrical object in the water. The object is clearly visible in my field of view, I am centered well enough over it, and my altitude is below 10 meters as required (specifically at 8 meters). All conditions for completing the task have been met.</Reasoning>
