I can now clearly see a red cylindrical object that appears to be floating in the water, which is definitely the anomaly we're looking for. I'm currently at 19 meters altitude, and I need to get below 10 meters while staying centered on the object. I'll move slightly to better center on the object (around 0, 6) and descend to 8 meters to ensure I'm within the required height requirement.</Reasoning>
