I can see what appears to be a port or dock area with water and some structures. To conduct an effective search, I should first move to a more central position and lower my altitude to get a better view of any potential anomalies. I'll move towards the center coordinates (0, 0) and decrease altitude by 30 meters to get a better view of the area.</Reasoning>
