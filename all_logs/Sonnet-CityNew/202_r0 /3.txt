<Reasoning>I can now clearly see what appears to be a military helicopter or aircraft between the buildings, which is definitely the anomalous object we're looking for. I'm currently at 14 meters altitude, but I need to get closer to be within 10 meters of it while keeping it centered in view. I'll move to position (0, 0) and descend slightly to get within the required range.</Reasoning>
