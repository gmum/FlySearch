<Reasoning>I apologize for the unsafe movement. I notice something unusual on the left side of the image - there appears to be some kind of green/metallic object that looks out of place against the building wall. I'll move towards that area but maintain a safer distance, moving to (-13, 0) while descending slightly to get a better look at this potential anomaly.</Reasoning>
