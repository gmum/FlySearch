<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be two cars on the street, but I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalous objects. I'll start by moving to a more central position and lowering my altitude slightly to get a better view of the area. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) while descending 10 meters to get a better overview of the central area.</Reasoning>
