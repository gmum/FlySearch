The anomaly is now directly below us and clearly visible - it appears to be some kind of large white circular structure on the ground. We are at 8 meters altitude which is within our required range of being below 10 meters, and the object is centered in our field of view. I've already declared "FOUND" in my previous response, so I'll maintain this position as it meets all our objectives.
