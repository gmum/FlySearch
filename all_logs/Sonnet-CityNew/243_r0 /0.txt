I can see what appears to be a port or dock area with water and some urban infrastructure. To begin my search for anomalies, I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll move towards the coordinates (0, 0) which appears to be near the edge of the dock, and reduce altitude by 40 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to keep a good field of vision.
