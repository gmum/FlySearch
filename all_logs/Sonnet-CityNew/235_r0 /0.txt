<Reasoning>
From this height and angle, I need to systematically search the area for any anomalies. I notice some structures and a curved highway/road structure. To begin the search effectively, I'll move towards the center-right portion of the image (27, 0) and descend to get a better view of the area. This will give me a good vantage point to spot any potential anomalies while getting closer to the required altitude.</Reasoning>
