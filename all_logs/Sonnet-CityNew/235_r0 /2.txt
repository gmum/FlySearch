I can now see what appears to be parked cars and some ground-level features more clearly. I notice something that looks unusual near the center of the image - it appears to be a circular or dome-like object that seems out of place among the rectangular structures and parked vehicles. I'll move to (0, 0) to center on this potential anomaly and descend further to get within the required 10-meter range.</Reasoning>
