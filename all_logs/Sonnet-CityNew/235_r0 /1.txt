I apologize for the aggressive descent. I can see more clearly now that there are buildings and structures that require careful navigation. I notice what appears to be some sort of platform or rooftop area. Let me move to (0, -20) and descend more gradually to get a better view of that area, while maintaining safe clearance from the structures.</Reasoning>
