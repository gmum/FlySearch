<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a yellow object (possibly a taxi or similar vehicle) near coordinates (19, -19). Since this stands out from the surrounding environment and could be the anomaly I'm looking for, I'll move towards it and decrease altitude to get a better look. I'll aim to get closer while maintaining visual contact.</Reasoning>
