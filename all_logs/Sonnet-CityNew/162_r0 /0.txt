<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a road construction site in the image, near coordinates (26, 0). There appears to be some road work or construction activity in that area. Since I need to get closer to confirm and need to be below 10 meters to complete the objective, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
