<Reasoning>I apologize for the previous unsafe move. From this new view, I can see what appears to be a gravelly or rocky surface. I still don't see the trash pile we're looking for. I should continue the search by moving to a new area. Since I've checked this area, I'll move to (19, 9) to explore the right side of the visible area while maintaining a safe altitude for now.</Reasoning>
