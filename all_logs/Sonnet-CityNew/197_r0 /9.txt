<Reasoning>After exploring multiple areas and directions, I still haven't located the trash pile. This appears to be another gravelly or textured surface. I've used up all my allowed moves (9 moves made) and haven't successfully located the target. I'll need to terminate the search as I've reached the movement limit without finding the trash pile.</Reasoning>
