<Reasoning>I'm starting at a high vantage point (33m) looking down at what appears to be a parking area or road. I don't see any obvious large trash pile from this position. I should conduct a systematic search by moving to a different area and lowering my altitude to get a better view. I'll move towards (-22, 0) which will let me scan the darker area on the left side of the image, and I'll descend to get a clearer view.</Reasoning>
