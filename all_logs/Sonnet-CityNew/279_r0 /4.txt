I notice that my attempts to move to (0, 12) keep triggering safety stops. This suggests there might be obstacles in that path. Instead, I should try moving to a different position that gives me a clear view of the area while maintaining a safer distance. I'll move to (12, 0) and descend just 5 meters to get a different angle while staying at a safer altitude.
