I've been approaching this incorrectly. The mission requires me to get below 10 meters of the object, but I've been too cautious staying at high altitudes. Looking at the scene again, I can see the intersection and streets more clearly now. I need to get to a position that will allow me to get closer to the target area while avoiding the buildings. Let me try moving to (15, 15) and this time make a more significant altitude gain to get above the buildings, then we can plan a proper descent.
