I've now made multiple attempts but keep encountering safety stops. We're in a very challenging urban canyon environment with tall buildings. Even though I can see what appears to be the target (the yellow object), I haven't been able to get close enough while maintaining safety. At this point, I should acknowledge that I may need to reconsider my approach or request additional guidance, as I've been unable to safely maneuver to a position that would allow me to get below 10 meters of the target while avoiding collisions with the surrounding buildings.
