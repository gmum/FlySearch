I need to completely revise my approach. The environment is extremely constrained with tall buildings, and nearly every movement is triggering safety stops. From my current position, I can actually see what appears to be our target - the yellow object near (0, 12). Instead of trying to move closer, which keeps triggering safety stops, I should stay at my current position and try to gain some altitude to get a better overall perspective.
