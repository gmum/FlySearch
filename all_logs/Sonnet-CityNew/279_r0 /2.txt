I apologize for the unsafe previous move. From this new altitude of 36 meters, I can see a bright yellow object near (0, 12) that seems unusual and could be our target. I'll move towards it but maintain a safer descent rate this time, going down just 15 meters to get a closer look while staying centered above it.
