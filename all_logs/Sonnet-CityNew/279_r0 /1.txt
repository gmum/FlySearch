<Reasoning>
At 49 meters, I have a clearer view but still need to get lower to spot any potential anomalies. I notice some yellow taxis and regular traffic, but nothing unusual yet. I'll continue descending while moving slightly towards the intersection at (16, 16) where I can see more of the street activity. I'll descend another 25 meters to get a much closer look.
