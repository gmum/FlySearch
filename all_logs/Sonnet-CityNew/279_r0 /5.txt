I need to rethink my strategy. Even small descents are triggering safety stops. Looking at the scene again, there are tall buildings around us, and we need to be very careful with our movements. Let me try moving to (24, 24) which appears to be more in the open street area, without changing altitude for now. This will give me a different perspective while maintaining our current safe height.
