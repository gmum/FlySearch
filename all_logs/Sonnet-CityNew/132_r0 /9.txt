<Reasoning>I have now made my maximum number of allowed moves (9) and have thoroughly searched the visible area at a low altitude of 8 meters, but I have not found a large trash pile. I've covered various sections including near buildings, along the street, and in corners, but have only seen normal urban features like parked cars, some containers, and building structures.</Reasoning>
