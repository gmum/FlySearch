<Reasoning>From this altitude, I can see what appears to be an urban area with buildings and streets. I don't immediately spot a large trash pile, but I should systematically search the area. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll aim for the (0,0) position and decrease altitude by 20 meters to get a clearer view.</Reasoning>
