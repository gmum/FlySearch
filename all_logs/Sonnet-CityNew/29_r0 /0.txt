<Reasoning>From this aerial view, I can see several parked vehicles but no clear blue sports car yet. I need to systematically search the area and get lower to better identify vehicles. I'll move slightly to the left (west) of my current position and decrease altitude to get a better view of the vehicles on that side of the street.</Reasoning>
