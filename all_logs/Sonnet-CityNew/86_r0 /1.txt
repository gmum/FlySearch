<Reasoning>
From this lower altitude (49m), I can see the street more clearly. I notice some activity near the crosswalk area around (0, 16). There might be people gathering there. I'll move towards that location and continue descending to get a better view of what appears to be potential crowd activity. I'll descend another 30 meters to get closer to the required height while moving slightly north.</Reasoning>
