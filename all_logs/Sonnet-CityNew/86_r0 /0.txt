<Reasoning>
I need to search for a crowd in this urban environment. From this height (99m), it's difficult to clearly spot people. I can see what appears to be a street intersection and some buildings. I'll start by descending to get a better view while staying roughly in the center area, as crowds are likely to gather near street intersections. I'll move slightly towards (0, 0) and descend by 50 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to keep a good field of vision.</Reasoning>
