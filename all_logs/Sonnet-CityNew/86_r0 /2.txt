<Reasoning>
Now at 19 meters, I can see several people at the crosswalk intersection more clearly. There appears to be a small gathering of people near the crosswalk area around (6, 6). I'll move slightly towards that position and descend to get within the required 10-meter height, as I want to be centered over the crowd while maintaining visual contact.</Reasoning>
