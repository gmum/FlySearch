From this aerial view at 43 meters, I can see a parking lot and streets, but no obvious fire yet. Given that fires can be spotted by smoke or flames, I should conduct a systematic search starting with the area that looks most promising. I notice some unusual coloring in the bottom left corner that should be investigated. I'll move to that area and lower my altitude to get a better view.
