I can now see what appears to be a large concrete or paved area with some structures. I notice something that might be unusual near the bottom of the image around coordinates (0, -42). I should move closer to that location and lower my altitude further to investigate if this could be our target anomaly. I'll descend another 30 meters to get a better view.
