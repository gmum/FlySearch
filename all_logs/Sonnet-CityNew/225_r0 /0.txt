From this altitude, I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. I notice what appears to be a construction or urban area. To get a better view, I should first lower my altitude while moving towards the center-south area where there appears to be an open space with different textures. This will give me a better vantage point to spot any anomalies. I'll move to coordinates (0, -31) and decrease altitude by 30 meters to get a closer look at this area.
