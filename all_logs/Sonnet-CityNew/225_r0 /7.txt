I can now clearly see two yellow taxi cabs that stand out from the environment - these appear to be our anomaly. I am currently at 9 meters altitude which is within our target range of being below 10 meters, and I have a clear view of these unusual yellow vehicles in my field of view. This matches our search criteria for an object that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment.
