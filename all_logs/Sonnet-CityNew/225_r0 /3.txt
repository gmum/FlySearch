<Reasoning>
I apologize for the unsafe maneuver. I see now that there's a reflective surface/structure that I need to be more careful around. I can see what appears to be an unusual bright spot or anomaly, but I need to approach it more carefully. Let me move to coordinates (0, -11) to get a better angle while descending at a safer rate of 15 meters. This will help me maintain a safer distance from the structures while still getting closer to investigate the potential anomaly.
