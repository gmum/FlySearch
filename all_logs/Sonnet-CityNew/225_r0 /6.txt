From this new angle, I can see what appears to be yellow vehicles or objects that stand out from the rest of the environment. This could be our anomaly. I'll move to coordinates (18, -9) to get closer to these yellow objects while maintaining a safer altitude, only descending by 18 meters to ensure I stay above 10 meters from the ground level while getting a better view.
