I need to completely rethink my approach. I keep getting emergency stops because I'm trying to get too close to the structure. Let me try moving to a position that gives me a better viewing angle while maintaining a safer distance. I'll move to coordinates (-21, -21) which should keep me well away from the structure but still allow me to observe the area, and I'll make a smaller altitude adjustment of just 5 meters to be extra cautious.
