I can now see what appears to be some kind of geometric pattern or structure with glass/reflective panels on the right side. I notice there's an unusual lighter-colored area or anomaly near coordinates (11, -11). I should move closer to that location and lower my altitude to get within 10 meters of it to confirm if this is our target. I'll move slightly to the right and down while descending another 24 meters to get within the required range.
