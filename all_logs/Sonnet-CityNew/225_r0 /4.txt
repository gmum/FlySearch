I need to be much more cautious. I can see what appears to be an anomaly (bright spot) near the reflective structure, but my previous approaches were too aggressive. Let me try a different strategy. I'll move to coordinates (-11, -11) which will keep me at a safer distance from the structure while still maintaining visual of the area, and I'll descend by just 10 meters this time to ensure safety.
