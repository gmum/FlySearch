<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be yellow road markings or crosswalks in a few locations in the image. These appear to be normal features of the urban environment. To conduct a thorough search for any anomalous objects, I'll first move to a more central position and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll position myself near the center intersection and descend to about 40 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to scan the surroundings.</Reasoning>
