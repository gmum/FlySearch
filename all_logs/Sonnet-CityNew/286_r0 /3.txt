<Reasoning>I can now clearly see what appears to be our target anomaly - there's what looks like a drone or small aircraft on the ground near coordinates (3, 3). This object definitely doesn't belong in the middle of an intersection and stands out from the normal road environment. I'm already at a good altitude of 8 meters, which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view.</Reasoning>
