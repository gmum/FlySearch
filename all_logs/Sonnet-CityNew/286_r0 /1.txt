<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see more details of the street and buildings. I notice the yellow crosswalk markings at the intersection in the upper part of the image. I should investigate that area more closely, as crosswalk markings might be relevant, and I need to get lower to properly inspect any potential anomalies. I'll move slightly towards the upper crosswalk and continue descending to get a better view.</Reasoning>
