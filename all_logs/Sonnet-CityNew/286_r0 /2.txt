<Reasoning>I can now see all four crosswalks at this intersection clearly. There doesn't appear to be anything unusual about these crosswalks - they are standard yellow pedestrian crossings. However, I notice something that looks unusual in the center of the intersection. The center appears to be a distinctly dark square that seems different from the regular road surface. This could be our anomaly. I'll move to center myself over this dark square area and descend further to inspect it more closely.</Reasoning>
