From this high altitude of 96 meters, I can see an urban environment with what appears to be train tracks or rails. I need to systematically search the area for any anomalies. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll move towards (0, 0) and descend by 40 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue the search effectively.
