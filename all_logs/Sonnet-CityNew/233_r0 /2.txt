At this lower altitude of 26 meters, I can now see more clearly. There appears to be some parked vehicles and road markings. I notice something that might be unusual near (-9, 0) - there seems to be some kind of object there that might be our anomaly. I'll move towards that position and lower my altitude further to get a better look, descending by 20 meters to get closer while still maintaining enough height to confirm if this is our target.
