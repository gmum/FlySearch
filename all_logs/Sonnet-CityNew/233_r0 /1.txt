From this lower altitude of 56 meters, I can see more details of the environment. I notice what appears to be some lights or reflective surfaces in the upper portion of the image. I'll move slightly forward (towards positive y) and continue descending to investigate that area more closely. I'll drop another 30 meters to get a better view while moving towards (0, 19).
