<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a fire or bright light source near coordinates (16, 0). I should move closer to that position and reduce altitude to get a better view and verify if this is the target fire. I'll move directly to those coordinates and descend by 40 meters to get closer to the required height.</Reasoning>
