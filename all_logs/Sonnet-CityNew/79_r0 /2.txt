<Reasoning>I can see some construction equipment and materials in the lower left of the image, but I need to check the area around (-11, -11) where there appears to be some accumulated materials or debris. I'll move there and lower my altitude slightly more to confirm if this is the trash pile we're looking for.</Reasoning>
