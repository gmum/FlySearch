<Reasoning>I can see an industrial/urban area from above, but I don't immediately spot a large trash pile. I should conduct a systematic search starting with the lower right quadrant where there appears to be some construction or debris area. I'll move towards (38, -24) and lower my altitude to get a better view of that area.</Reasoning>
