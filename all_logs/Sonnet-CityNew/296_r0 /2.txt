<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a yellow vehicle that appears to be a taxi. I am already at 8 meters altitude, which is within the required range of being below 10 meters. The object is clearly in my field of view and I am centered over it. Since this yellow taxi stands out in the urban environment and I'm at the correct altitude to confirm it, I can conclude this is the anomaly I was searching for.</Reasoning>
