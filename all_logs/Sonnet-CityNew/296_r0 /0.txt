<Reasoning>I can see an urban intersection with tall buildings from a high altitude. Since I need to search for an anomaly, I should start by getting lower to have a better view of the street level where unusual objects would be more visible. I notice some yellow coloring near the (0, 49) coordinates that could be worth investigating. I'll move towards that area and decrease altitude significantly to get a clearer view.</Reasoning>
