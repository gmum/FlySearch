<Reasoning>Now I have a clearer view of the intersection and can see the yellow crosswalk markings in detail. I notice that one of the crosswalks appears to have an unusual pattern compared to the others. To properly inspect this potential anomaly, I need to lower my altitude further and position myself more directly above the crosswalk area.</Reasoning>
