<Reasoning>I can see an urban environment from above, with buildings, roads, and crosswalks. Since I need to find an anomalous object, I should start by systematically searching the area. I notice some yellow markings on the road that might be worth investigating closer. I'll move to a more central position and lower my altitude to get a better view of the street level details.</Reasoning>
