<Reasoning>I am now at a good altitude (6 meters) which is below the required 10 meters, and I can see the road construction site clearly in my field of view. The site appears to be in the lower portion of the image where there are visible construction markings and altered road surface. Since I'm centered on the construction site and at the correct altitude, I can confirm the target has been found.</Reasoning>
FOUND
