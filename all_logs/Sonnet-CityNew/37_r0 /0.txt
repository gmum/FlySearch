<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a highway or major road in the image, and there might be some construction activity visible in the lower portion. To get a better view of any potential road construction, I should move towards the center-right area where the road is visible and decrease altitude to get a closer look. I'll move to coordinates (24, -24) and descend by 40 meters to get a better view.</Reasoning>
