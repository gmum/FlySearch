<Reasoning>I can see some construction activity more clearly now - there appears to be some road work or construction site in the lower portion of the image. To get a better look and position myself properly above it, I'll move slightly towards (-10, -21) and continue descending to get below 10 meters above the construction site.</Reasoning>
