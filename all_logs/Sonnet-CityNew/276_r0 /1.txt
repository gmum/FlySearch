<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see the parking lot more clearly now. There appears to be something unusual near the (0, -15) coordinate - there seems to be a red vehicle or object that looks different from the regular parking pattern. I'll move to that position and lower my altitude further to investigate.</Reasoning>
