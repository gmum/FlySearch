I can now clearly see the trash pile in my field of view, and I'm positioned at 8 meters above it, which is below the required 10 meters. The pile is clearly visible and I'm centered well enough to identify it. Since I meet all the requirements - the object is in view, I'm below 10 meters, and I'm centered on it - I can confirm the find.
