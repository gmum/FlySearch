I can see what appears to be an aerial view of an urban area with buildings and rooftops. To effectively search for anomalies, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while maintaining a central position. I notice there's something that might be yellow near the center coordinates (0, 0), so I'll descend there to investigate it more closely.
