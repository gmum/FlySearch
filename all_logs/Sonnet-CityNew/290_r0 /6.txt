I appear to be in a confined space where many movements are restricted. The white circular object is clearly visible, and it appears to be mounted on a wall. Given my current altitude of 22 meters and the constraints of the space, I should try moving to a position that will give me a clear view while maintaining a safer distance. Let me try moving to the opposite side.
