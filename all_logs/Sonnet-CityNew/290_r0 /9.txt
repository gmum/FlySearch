I now realize I was in the wrong location earlier. What I thought was an anomaly (the white circular object) was actually part of the building's interior structure. Looking at this street view, I can see yellow taxis and regular street features. I need to continue searching for any actual anomalies in this outdoor environment. Let me move to get a better view of the area where the taxis are.
