I apologize for the aggressive descent. I can now see some building features more clearly. I notice what appears to be a white circular object near the center of the frame that seems out of place with the surrounding industrial/building materials. I'll make a more careful approach to investigate this potential anomaly, moving slightly down but maintaining a safer distance.
