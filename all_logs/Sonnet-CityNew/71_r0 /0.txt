<Reasoning>I notice this is an intersection with some roads and buildings. Since I'm tasked with finding a fire and I'm currently at 36 meters altitude, I should first scan the area systematically. I'll move towards the center of the intersection (0, 0) and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area.</Reasoning>
