I can see what appears to be an anomalous object near coordinates (7, 0) on the road surface. It looks out of place compared to the regular road markings and infrastructure. Since I need to be below 10 meters to confirm the find, and I'm currently at 22 meters, I'll move to those coordinates and descend by 15 meters to get within the required range.
