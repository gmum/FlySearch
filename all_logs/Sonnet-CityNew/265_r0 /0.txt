From this aerial view, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies. I notice the image shows mostly regular urban infrastructure including roads and buildings. To get a better view of the area while maintaining a good search pattern, I'll start by moving to a more central position and reducing altitude to get a clearer view of potential anomalies. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) and descend by 30 meters to get a better view while still maintaining enough height to survey the area effectively.
