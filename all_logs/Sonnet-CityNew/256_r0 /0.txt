<Reasoning>I can see an urban environment with roads, buildings, and some vehicles. I notice a yellow taxi on the road, but that's likely not our anomaly since taxis are common in urban areas. I should systematically search the area, focusing first on the brighter, well-lit portion of the image to the right side. I'll move towards (11, 0) and lower my altitude to get a better view of that area.</Reasoning>
