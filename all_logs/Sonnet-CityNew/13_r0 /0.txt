<Reasoning>From this aerial view of an urban intersection, I need to begin a systematic search for any signs of fire. I notice several areas to check, particularly the construction/work area on the left side of the image. I'll move towards that area and decrease altitude to get a better view of any potential fire sources. Moving to coordinates (-18, 0) and descending by 30 meters to get a closer look at this area.</Reasoning>
