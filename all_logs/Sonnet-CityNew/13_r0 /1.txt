<Reasoning>At this lower altitude, I can see more details of the area. There's no obvious fire visible in this section, but I should continue the systematic search. I notice some structures and trees in the right portion of the image that should be checked. I'll move slightly to the right and continue descending to get an even closer look at the area.</Reasoning>
