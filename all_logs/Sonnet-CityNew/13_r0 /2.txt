<Reasoning>Now at a much lower altitude of 9 meters, I have a close view of the area. I should continue the search pattern and check other areas since I don't see any signs of fire in this section. I'll move towards the right side of the viewing area where there are more trees and structures to inspect.</Reasoning>
