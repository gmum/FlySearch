I now understand that this location is too confined with too many obstacles to safely get below 10 meters of the trash pile. The space appears to be an enclosed alley or corridor with overhead structures that prevent safe close approach from above. Given these limitations and safety concerns, I should search for the trash pile in a different, more open location where I can safely descend to the required altitude.

Let me move to a new area with potentially better access, heading towards more open space.
