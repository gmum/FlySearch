I need to be more strategic. This area appears to be very confined with many obstacles. Let me try to gain some altitude first to get a better overview of the area and potentially find a safer approach path or a different location where the trash pile might be more accessible.

I'll ascend by 20 meters to get a better view while staying in my current position.
