After exploring multiple areas, I've come to realize that this entire area is a complex urban environment with buildings, overhangs, and structures that make it extremely difficult to safely descend below 10 meters anywhere. The trash pile we found earlier was under covered space, making it impossible to get the required close aerial view safely.

Let me make one final attempt to search for a more accessible area by moving to check what appears to be a different section.
