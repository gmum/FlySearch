After exploring multiple areas, I have to conclude that:
1. The trash pile we initially found is in a covered area that cannot be safely approached from above
2. The urban environment has too many overhead structures and obstacles
3. There don't appear to be any sufficiently open areas where we can safely descend below 10 meters

Given these constraints and safety concerns, I need to report that I cannot complete the mission as specified - I cannot get below 10 meters of the trash pile while maintaining visual contact and ensuring safety in this densely built urban environment.

Let me return to the starting position to regroup and potentially receive new instructions.
