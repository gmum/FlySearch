<Reasoning>
I can now see what appears to be a pile of debris or trash near coordinate (0, -11). I need to:
1. Move closer to that location
2. Lower my altitude further to get below 10 meters from the object
3. Center myself over the trash pile

I'll move to those coordinates and descend by 25 meters to get within the required 10-meter height requirement.
