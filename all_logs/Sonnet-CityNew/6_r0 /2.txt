<Reasoning>
I can see the trash pile more clearly now, but I need to be more careful with my descent to avoid hitting any structures. I can see there are some overhead obstacles, so I need to:
1. Make a more moderate descent
2. Stay centered over the trash pile
3. Get closer but maintain safe clearance

I'll make a more conservative descent of 15 meters while staying at my current horizontal position to get within the 10-meter requirement while avoiding obstacles.
