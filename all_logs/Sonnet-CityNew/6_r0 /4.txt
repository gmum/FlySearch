<Reasoning>
I see now that I cannot safely descend further in this location due to the overhead structures and confined space. The trash pile appears to be underneath some sort of covering or structure that prevents direct overhead access. I need to try a different approach:
1. Back up to get a better viewing angle
2. Move slightly away from the immediate area to find a safer approach
3. Try to view the pile from a different position where there might be fewer overhead obstacles
