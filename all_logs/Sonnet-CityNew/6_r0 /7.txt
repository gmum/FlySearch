From this higher vantage point, I can see that we're in a very confined urban environment with tall buildings and many overhead structures. The original trash pile I spotted is in an area that's too confined to safely approach from above due to overhead obstacles. I need to:
1. Search other areas that might be more accessible
2. Look for open spaces where I can safely descend
3. Move towards areas without overhead obstructions

Let me move towards what appears to be a more open area.
