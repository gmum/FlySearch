Now I can see the anomaly clearly - there appears to be a series of pipes or tubes arranged in a corner pattern in the lower left portion of the image. This must be our target object. From this higher altitude, I can see it's near coordinates (-10, -20). I'll move towards it while maintaining enough altitude to stay safe.</Reasoning>
