I've now used up many moves and keep getting emergency stops. It seems there might be invisible barriers or safety zones that are preventing most movements. Since I can't seem to move safely in any direction and I'm running out of moves, I should stay where I am and observe what I can see. The area appears to have some kind of waterway or canal with structural features alongside it. However, I haven't been able to get close enough to the anomaly to confirm it within the required parameters.</Reasoning>
