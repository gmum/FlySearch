<Reasoning>
Now at 27 meters, I can see what appears to be an open area with some concrete or paved surface. I notice something that looks reflective or unusual near the bottom of the image. I'll move closer to the center of that area and reduce altitude further to get a better look at what might be our anomaly.</Reasoning>
