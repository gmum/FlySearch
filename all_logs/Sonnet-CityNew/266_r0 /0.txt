From this aerial view at 57 meters, I can see an urban environment with buildings and roads. I need to perform a systematic search to find any anomalies. I notice something that looks unusual in the bottom-center of the image, near coordinates (0, -38). I'll move closer to that area and reduce altitude to get a better look.</Reasoning>
