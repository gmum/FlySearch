I need to rethink my approach. I keep getting emergency stops, which suggests I'm not choosing safe movements. I can see the reflective anomaly in the lower portion of the image. Instead of trying to get too close or make diagonal movements, let me try a more conservative approach. I'll move to (8, 0) first to get a different perspective while maintaining the current altitude.</Reasoning>
