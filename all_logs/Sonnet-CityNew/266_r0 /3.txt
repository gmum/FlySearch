I need to adjust my strategy. I've been trying to get too close to the ground too quickly. Let me try a different approach. I can see what appears to be an anomaly (reflective surface) in the bottom portion of the image, but I need to be more careful with my movements. I'll move to (8, -8) to get a different angle and make a smaller altitude adjustment.</Reasoning>
