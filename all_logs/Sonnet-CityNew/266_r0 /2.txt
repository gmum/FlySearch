<Reasoning>
I apologize for the aggressive descent. From this view at 25 meters, I can see what appears to be a reflective or unusual surface pattern near the bottom of the image. I'll move slightly towards it but maintain a safer descent rate this time. Moving to (0, -17) and descending just 10 meters to investigate the anomaly more closely.</Reasoning>
