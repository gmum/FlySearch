<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a yellow taxi or vehicle in the lower portion of the image, near coordinates (23, -23). Since this could be our target object, I'll move closer to that position and reduce altitude to get a better look. I'll aim to get within 10 meters of it to confirm if this is the anomaly we're searching for.</Reasoning>
