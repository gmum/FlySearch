<Reasoning>I'm now at a good altitude (9 meters), which is below our 10-meter requirement. I can see what appears to be the yellow taxi much more clearly now. Since this appears to be an unusual object in the environment (most other vehicles are parked in designated spots), and I'm properly positioned above it with the correct altitude, I can confirm this is our target.</Reasoning>
