From this aerial view, I can see various urban structures but no clear large trash pile yet. Given the objective to find a trash pile and the need to search thoroughly, I should move to a lower altitude to get a better view while maintaining a systematic search pattern. I'll start by moving towards the northeast quadrant (16, 16) and descending to get a clearer view of the area.
