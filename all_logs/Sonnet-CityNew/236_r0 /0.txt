<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a yellow object in the lower left corner of the image, near coordinates (-51, -51). Since this stands out against the grey urban environment, this is likely our target anomaly. I'll move towards that location and decrease altitude to get a better view and get within the required 10 meter range.</Reasoning>
