<Reasoning>I can see a bright light source that seems out of place in this environment - it appears to be the anomaly I'm looking for. It's located near coordinate (0, 3). I'm already at a good altitude of 10 meters, but I need to center myself directly on the anomalous light to meet the objective requirements.</Reasoning>
