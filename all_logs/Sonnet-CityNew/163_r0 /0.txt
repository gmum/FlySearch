<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a road from above, but no clear construction site is visible yet. I'll move towards the center-right area (25, -25) and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area. This will allow me to scan more carefully for any signs of construction while maintaining a safe distance.</Reasoning>
