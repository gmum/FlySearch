<Reasoning>I can see a flat surface below, possibly a rooftop. Since my previous move was too aggressive and nearly caused a collision, I'll be more cautious. I'll move to position (0, -28) and decrease altitude by 20 meters to get a better view of the southern area while maintaining safe distance.</Reasoning>
