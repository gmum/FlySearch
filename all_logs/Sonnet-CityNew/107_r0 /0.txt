<Reasoning>I can see several rooftops from my current altitude of 92 meters. I need to perform a systematic search pattern and get lower to better identify any potential trash piles. I'll move towards the center-right area (31, 31) and decrease altitude by 30 meters to get a better view of that section.</Reasoning>
