<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be some yellow objects near the street level. This could potentially be the trash pile I'm looking for. To investigate this area more closely, I need to descend while staying in this general area. I'll maintain my current x,y position but reduce my altitude by 50 meters to get a closer look, which should put me at around 9 meters above ground level - within our target range of under 10 meters.</Reasoning>
