<Reasoning>I need to be more careful about avoiding obstacles. From this new position, I still need to search for the trash pile. I notice I'm in a dense urban area with buildings, so I should maintain a safer distance while searching. I'll move towards the negative y direction (south) while maintaining my current altitude to continue the search in a new area.</Reasoning>
