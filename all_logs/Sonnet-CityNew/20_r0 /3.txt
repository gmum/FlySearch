<Reasoning>From this higher vantage point, I can see more of the area. I notice there appears to be some activity or objects near the street on the left side of the image, including what might be yellow vehicles or objects. I should investigate that area while maintaining a safe altitude initially. I'll move towards coordinates (-20, -20) to get a better view of that area.</Reasoning>
