<Reasoning>I can now see a clear road construction site with fresh pavement and markings. I'm at 10 meters altitude which is just at our maximum allowed height. To ensure we're fully compliant with the requirement to be below 10 meters, I'll descend just slightly to 9 meters while staying centered on the construction area.</Reasoning>
