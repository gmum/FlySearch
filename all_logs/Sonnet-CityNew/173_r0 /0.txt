<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small fire or smoke near coordinate (0, 0). Since I need to get closer to confirm and need to be below 10 meters to properly identify it, I'll move to that position and descend to about 8 meters altitude. This should give me a clear view while staying within the required height parameters.</Reasoning>
