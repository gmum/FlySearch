<Reasoning>From this new position, I can see better details of the area but don't see a large trash pile yet. I notice some activity in the upper portion of the image where there might be some accumulation of materials. I'll move towards coordinates (0, 23) and continue descending to get an even closer look at what appears to be some material accumulation in that direction.</Reasoning>
