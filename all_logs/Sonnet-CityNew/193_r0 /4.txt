<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the pile of what appears to be red/orange barrels or debris. I am currently at 8 meters altitude which is within our target range of being below 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view. This matches the description of a large trash pile we were looking for.</Reasoning>
