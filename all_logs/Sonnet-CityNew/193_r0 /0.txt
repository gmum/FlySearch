<Reasoning>I can see some areas that look industrial/commercial with potential for trash accumulation, but I need to get a better view. I'll move towards the right side of the image (east) where there appears to be some activity or material storage, and lower my altitude to get a better look. I'll aim for coordinates (22, 0) while descending 30 meters to get a clearer view of that area.</Reasoning>
