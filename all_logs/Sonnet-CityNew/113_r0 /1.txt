<Reasoning>At 27 meters, I have a better view of the streets now. I can see some vehicles, including what appears to be a yellow taxi, but no blue sports car yet. I notice there's more street area to explore in the negative y direction. I'll move south and continue descending to get an even closer look at the vehicles.</Reasoning>
