<Reasoning>From this aerial view at 57 meters, I can see several streets and buildings, but I don't spot a blue sports car yet. I should first lower my altitude to get a better view of the vehicles on the streets. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) and descend by 30 meters to get a clearer view of the central intersection area.</Reasoning>
