<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a road from an aerial view, with some vehicles parked along it. There appears to be some construction or road work activity on this road. Since my objective is to find a road construction site and get below 10 meters above it, I need to:
1. Center myself better over the road area
2. Significantly reduce my altitude to get closer to the target
I'll move to (0,0) coordinates and lower my altitude by 22 meters to get below 10 meters above the road.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -22)</Action>
