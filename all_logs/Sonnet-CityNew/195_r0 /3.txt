<Reasoning>I need to be much more careful about altitude and building heights in this urban environment. I'm currently at 30m and still need to locate the trash pile. Let me move to a safer position by going up first to clear the buildings, then moving to a new search area. I'll increase altitude by 20m and move to (20, 20) to check a different area.</Reasoning>
