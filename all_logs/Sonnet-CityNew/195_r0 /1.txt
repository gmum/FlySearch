<Reasoning>I'm now at 50m altitude and still don't see any clear signs of a large trash pile. I should continue searching and get even lower for better visibility. I notice some areas near the intersection that I should inspect more closely. I'll move towards (17, -17) and descend another 20 meters to get a better look at that area.</Reasoning>
