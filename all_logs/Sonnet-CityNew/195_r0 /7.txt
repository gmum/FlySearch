<Reasoning>At 15m altitude, I have a much clearer view of the street level. I can see some taxis and cars, but no significant trash pile in this area. I notice an area near (-10, -10) that I should check more closely. I'll move there while maintaining this altitude since it seems safe enough to observe while still being able to spot a trash pile.</Reasoning>
