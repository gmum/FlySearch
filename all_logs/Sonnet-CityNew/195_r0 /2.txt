<Reasoning>I apologize for the unsafe move. I'm now at 31m altitude and need to be more careful about buildings and obstacles. From this view, I still need to search for the trash pile. I'll move to a safer position at (0, -21) to continue the search, and descend a bit more carefully this time by only 10 meters.</Reasoning>
