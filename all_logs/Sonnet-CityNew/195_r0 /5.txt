<Reasoning>I appear to be in a situation where I'm surrounded by tall buildings, making movement risky. Looking at the image more carefully, I notice there's a street level below. The safest approach would be to move to (-20, 0) which appears to be above the street, away from the buildings, while maintaining the current altitude. This should give me a clearer view of the street level where a trash pile would more likely be located.</Reasoning>
