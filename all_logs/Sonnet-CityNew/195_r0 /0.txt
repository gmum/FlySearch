<Reasoning>I'm currently at a high altitude (80m) with an aerial view of what appears to be an urban intersection. I don't see any obvious large trash pile from this height and position. I should start by descending to get a better view while moving slightly to cover more area. I'll move towards (-27, -27) coordinates and descend by 30 meters to get a clearer view of that section.</Reasoning>
