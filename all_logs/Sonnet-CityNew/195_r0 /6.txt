<Reasoning>Now I have a better view of the street level. From this position at 30m altitude, I can see the street more clearly but still need to get lower to properly identify any trash piles. The area near (-10, -20) looks like it might have something worth investigating. I'll move there while carefully descending 15 meters to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
