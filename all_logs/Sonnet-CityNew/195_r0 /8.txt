<Reasoning>I'm still at 15m altitude and have searched several areas of the street, but haven't located any significant trash pile. I notice an area near (-5, -10) that I haven't examined closely yet. Since I've used 8 moves already and only have 1 move left, I need to make this final move count. I'll move there while maintaining the current altitude which allows for good visibility while staying safe.</Reasoning>
