FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now at 9 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters. The anomaly is perfectly centered in my view at (0, 0), and I have a clear line of sight to it. These conditions satisfy all the requirements - being below 10 meters, having the object in view, and being centered on it.
