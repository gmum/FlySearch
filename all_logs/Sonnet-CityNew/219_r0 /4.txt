<Reasoning>
I apologize for my previous unsafe moves. I can see the anomaly clearly, and I'm currently at 16 meters altitude. Since I need to be below 10 meters to complete the task, but my previous attempts to get closer were unsafe, I'll try a more conservative approach. I'll stay in roughly the same horizontal position but reduce altitude more carefully.
