I can now see the anomaly from a different angle, and I'm at 14 meters altitude. The anomaly is near (-5, 0) in my current view. Since my previous attempts to get much lower were unsafe, and I can clearly see the anomaly from this position, I'll try one more careful adjustment to get a better viewing angle and slightly lower altitude.
