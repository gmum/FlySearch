I need to systematically search the area for any anomalies. From this height, I can see several buildings and roads, but I need to get lower to spot any potential anomalies. I notice there's a large area in the center of the image, so I'll start by moving to the center coordinates and reducing altitude significantly to get a better view of the area.
