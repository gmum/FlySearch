I need to reconsider my approach. My attempts to get closer or lower are resulting in safety stops. Looking at the situation, I can see the anomaly clearly from my current position at 16 meters, but I can't seem to safely get below 10 meters as required. Let me try moving to a slightly different viewing angle that might allow for a safer descent.
