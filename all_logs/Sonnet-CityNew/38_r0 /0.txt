<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a pile of reddish-brown objects or trash near coordinate (0, 11). Since I'm currently at 32 meters altitude and need to get below 10 meters to properly identify and confirm the target, I'll move directly to those coordinates and descend to 8 meters altitude. This will put me in a good position to confirm if this is the trash pile we're looking for while ensuring I'm below the required 10-meter height.</Reasoning>
