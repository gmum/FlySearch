<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a group of people (a crowd) near the center of the image, around coordinate (0, 14). The crowd is on what looks like a street or walkway between buildings. Since I need to get closer and lower to confirm this sighting, I'll move to that position and significantly reduce altitude to get below 10 meters above them.</Reasoning>
