<Reasoning>I can see an urban intersection from above, but no large trash pile is immediately visible. Given the height and area to search, I should systematically explore while gradually decreasing altitude to get a better view. I'll start by moving to a position that gives me a good vantage point of the wider area while descending to see more detail.</Reasoning>
