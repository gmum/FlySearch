I'm now at a good altitude of 9 meters, which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters. However, I can see several parked vehicles but none appears to be a black pickup truck in this immediate view. I need to move along the street to continue the search while maintaining this good altitude. I'll move to (-6, 0) to check the vehicles in that direction.
