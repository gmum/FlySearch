Now I have a good view of a street with parked vehicles! I can see several cars parked along what appears to be a street or alley. I need to get lower to better identify if any of these vehicles is the black pickup truck we're looking for. I'll descend while staying roughly in this position to get a clearer view of the vehicles below.
