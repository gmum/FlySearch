I apologize for the unsafe maneuver. I see now that I'm near some structural elements that could be dangerous. This appears to be a rooftop or covered area, and I don't see the parking lot anymore. I need to move back to a safer position and try a different direction. I'll move towards (25, 25) to get away from these structures and maintain the current altitude for safety.
