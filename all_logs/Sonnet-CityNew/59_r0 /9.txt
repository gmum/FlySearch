<Reasoning>
I have now exhausted my 9 moves and have thoroughly searched the visible parking areas, but I have not found the black pickup truck. The vehicles I've seen have been mostly sedans and other passenger vehicles, but no black pickup truck. Since I cannot make any more moves and haven't found the target vehicle, I cannot report "FOUND".
