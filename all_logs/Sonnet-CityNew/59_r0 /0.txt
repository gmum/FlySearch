From this aerial view at 83 meters, I can see several parking lots and buildings, but I don't immediately spot a black pickup truck. I should start by getting lower to have a better view of the vehicles in the parking lots. The left side appears to have a larger parking area, so I'll start my search there while descending to about 40 meters to get a better view.
