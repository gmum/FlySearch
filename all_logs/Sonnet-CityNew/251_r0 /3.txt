<Reasoning>I need to revise my approach. The yellow taxi is clearly visible at (13, 6), and I'm at 19 meters altitude. Given the previous emergency stops, I should make a more conservative movement. I'll try to position myself directly above the taxi with a minimal altitude change to ensure safety.</Reasoning>
