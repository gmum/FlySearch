<Reasoning>Unfortunately, I've been unable to successfully navigate closer to the yellow taxi while meeting the requirement of being below 10 meters altitude. While I can clearly see the anomaly (the yellow taxi), I haven't been able to get close enough vertically due to the environmental constraints and safety systems preventing potentially dangerous movements. Since I cannot meet the core requirement of being below 10 meters while keeping the object in view, I cannot legitimately declare "FOUND".</Reasoning>
