<Reasoning>I need to change my strategy. Instead of trying to move directly to the taxi's position, I should first try to get closer horizontally while maintaining my current safe altitude. The taxi is at approximately (13, 6), so I'll move to (6, 6) first to get closer while staying at the same height.</Reasoning>
