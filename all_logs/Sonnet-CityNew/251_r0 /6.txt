<Reasoning>I seem to be having difficulty with horizontal movements in this urban environment. Given that I'm at 19 meters altitude and can clearly see the yellow taxi, I'll try a very small movement to position (6, 13) while maintaining altitude. This should give me a safer approach angle.</Reasoning>
