<Reasoning>I can now see the anomaly clearly - it appears to be an unusual white/light colored marking or object on the asphalt, distinct from the regular yellow road markings. I am already at a good altitude (9 meters) which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is in my field of view. I will center myself more precisely over it.</Reasoning>
