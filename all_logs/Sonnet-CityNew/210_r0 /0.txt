<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an anomaly - there's a bright white/light colored area near the coordinates (-16, -33) that stands out from the regular urban environment of buildings and roads. I'll move closer to that location and reduce altitude to investigate this potential anomaly more closely.</Reasoning>
