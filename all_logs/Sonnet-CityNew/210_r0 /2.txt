<Reasoning>I am now perfectly centered over what appears to be the anomalous object - a white/light colored marking or object on the asphalt that's clearly different from the regular yellow road markings. I am at 9 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view and centered.</Reasoning>
