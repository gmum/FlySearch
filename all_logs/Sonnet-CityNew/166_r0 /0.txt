<Reasoning>I can see a road intersection from this aerial view, but I need to search for any signs of construction. Let me first move towards (0,0) and lower my altitude to get a better view of the central area. This will help me scan the area more effectively while maintaining a reasonable height to continue the search.</Reasoning>
