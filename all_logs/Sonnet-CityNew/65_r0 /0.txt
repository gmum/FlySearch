<Reasoning>I can see an urban environment from a high vantage point. From this altitude and position, I need to search systematically for any crowds. I should first move to a position that gives me a better view of the street level while staying centered. I'll descend to get a clearer view while moving slightly to coordinate (0,0) to maintain a central position.</Reasoning>
