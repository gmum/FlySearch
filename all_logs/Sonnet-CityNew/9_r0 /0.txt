<Reasoning>I need to systematically search for the trash pile. From this high altitude (96m), I can see a good overview of the area but need to get lower to spot details. I notice what appears to be building rooftops and alleys. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering altitude significantly to get a better view of the area between buildings.</Reasoning>
