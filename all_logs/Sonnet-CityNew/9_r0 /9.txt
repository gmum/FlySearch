<Reasoning>Unfortunately, I've used up all my allowed moves (9 moves) and haven't been able to locate the trash pile. From what I can see in this final position, there's mostly just road surface, street markings, and some parked vehicles. I wasn't successful in finding the target object within the move limit.</Reasoning>
