From the aerial view, I need to conduct a systematic search for the fire. I notice this is an urban environment with buildings and roads. Since fires are more likely to be visible in open areas first, I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (0,0) which appears to be at an intersection and lower my altitude by 35 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining safe distance from structures.
