<Reasoning>
I can now see what appears to be a fire or bright spot on the ground near coordinates (0, -5). I am already at a good altitude of 8 meters, which is below the required 10 meters, and the object appears to be centered in my field of view. Since I can clearly see the fire and am positioned correctly, I should report it.
