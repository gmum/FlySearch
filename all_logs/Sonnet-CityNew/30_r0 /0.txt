From this initial aerial view at 68 meters, I can see a highway and some buildings, but no clear trash pile yet. I should start by systematically searching the area and lowering my altitude to get a better view. I'll move towards the eastern side of the image where there appears to be some structures and potential areas where trash might accumulate, while simultaneously descending to get a clearer view.
