At 18 meters, I have a much clearer view of the area, but I still need to continue my search. I can see some parked cars and different sections of the highway, but no clear trash pile yet. I'll move towards the darker area of the highway where there might be some accumulated debris, while maintaining this lower altitude which gives good visibility.
