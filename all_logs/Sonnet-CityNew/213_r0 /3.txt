FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly centered over the anomalous reddish markings on the street at coordinates (0, 3), and my altitude is 8 meters, which is below the required 10 meters. The object is clearly in my field of view and I am centered on it. These conditions satisfy all the requirements for declaring the object as found.
