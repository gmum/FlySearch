Now that I'm lower, I can see more details of the street. I notice what appears to be an anomaly near the coordinates (4, 4) - there seems to be something unusual on the street that doesn't fit with the regular street patterns. I'll move slightly towards that position and descend a bit more to get a clearer view and ensure I'm within 10 meters of the ground level.
