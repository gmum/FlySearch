<Reasoning>I can see several cars parked on the street below. From this height and angle, I should first move closer to get a better view of the vehicles while maintaining a systematic search pattern. I'll move to (15, 15) and decrease altitude by 20 meters to get a clearer view of the vehicles in that area.</Reasoning>
