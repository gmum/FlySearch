<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a bridge or elevated roadway structure in the image. Since I need to search for an anomaly, I should first get a better view of the central area where there appears to be an intersection. I'll move to the center position (0,0) and reduce altitude to get a better view of any potential anomalies in this urban environment.</Reasoning>
