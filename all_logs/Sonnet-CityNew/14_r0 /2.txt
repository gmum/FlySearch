<Reasoning>I can see I'm in what appears to be a parking garage, but the yellow glow I saw was actually just a yellow car, not a fire. I notice what appears to be a flame or fire symbol at coordinates (5, 3). I'll move closer to investigate while maintaining my low altitude, as I'm already within the required 10-meter height.</Reasoning>
