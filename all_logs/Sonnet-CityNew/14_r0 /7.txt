<Reasoning>I appear to be in a very confined space with a low ceiling. The multiple emergency stops indicate that the parking garage structure is too restrictive for safe movement. Given that I can see what appears to be a fire indicator or emergency light in the distance but can't safely reach it due to obstacles, I should try moving backwards to get a better approach angle.</Reasoning>
