<Reasoning>
From this aerial view of an urban intersection, I need to conduct a systematic search for any signs of fire. The current altitude of 66 meters is too high to effectively spot a fire, so I should descend while maintaining a central position. I'll move down by 30 meters first to get a better view while staying at the center coordinates.
