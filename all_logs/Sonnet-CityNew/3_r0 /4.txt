I notice I need to be more careful with my movements. The fire appears to be in view, and I'm at 13 meters altitude. Since I need to be below 10 meters and I keep getting emergency stops when trying to move horizontally, I'll try a small vertical descent from my current position to get under the 10-meter requirement while keeping the fire in view.
