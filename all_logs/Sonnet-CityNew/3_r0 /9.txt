I have been unable to successfully complete the mission within the given constraints. The urban environment with tall buildings and obstacles prevented safe descent below 10 meters while maintaining visual contact with the fire. The closest I got was 13 meters, but further descent attempts resulted in emergency stops. A different approach angle or different response strategy may be needed for this particular urban fire scenario.
