I've used my maximum number of moves (9) and haven't been able to safely get below 10 meters while keeping the fire in view. The urban environment with its buildings and obstacles has made it challenging to get close enough while maintaining safety. I should report that this position may not be optimal for observing the fire and a different approach or different type of response might be needed.
