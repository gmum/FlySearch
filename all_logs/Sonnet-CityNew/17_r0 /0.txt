<Reasoning>I can see a road from an aerial view with what appears to be some construction or road work in progress, indicated by the lighter colored pavement sections. To get a better view and position myself correctly over the construction site, I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) which appears to be centered over the road work, and reduce altitude by 29 meters to get below 10 meters height as required.</Reasoning>
