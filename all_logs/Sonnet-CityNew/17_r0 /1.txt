<Reasoning>I can now see the road construction site much more clearly at this lower altitude. I can see what appears to be road work with construction equipment and vehicles. I am at 9 meters altitude which is within the required range (below 10 meters) and I am centered on the construction area. Since I meet all the criteria - being centered on the target, having it in my field of view, and being below 10 meters altitude - I can confirm the finding.</Reasoning>
