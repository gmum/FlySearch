<Reasoning>I can see urban buildings and streets from a high altitude of 54 meters. To find a crowd, I should first move to a position that gives me a better view of the street level where people are likely to gather. I'll move to the center point (0,0) and significantly reduce altitude to get a clearer view of the street.</Reasoning>
