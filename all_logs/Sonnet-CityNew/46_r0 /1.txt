<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see more detail of the area. I notice some objects in the western part of the image, near (-20, -10) coordinates. I should move closer to that area and descend further to investigate if this might be the trash pile I'm looking for. This will get me into a better position to confirm what these objects are.</Reasoning>
