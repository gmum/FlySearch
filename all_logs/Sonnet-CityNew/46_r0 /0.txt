<Reasoning>I'm currently at a high altitude (61m) looking down at what appears to be a city intersection. Since I'm looking for a large trash pile, I should conduct a systematic search starting by descending to get a better view of the area, while moving slightly southwest where there appears to be some objects or debris. This will help me get a clearer view of potential targets while maintaining a good search position.</Reasoning>
