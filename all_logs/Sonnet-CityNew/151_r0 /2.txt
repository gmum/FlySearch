<Reasoning>I can see some red objects (possibly umbrellas or temporary structures) in the top portion of the image, but I need to search the area further. I notice a different area that looks promising near (9, 9) where there appears to be some disturbance in the ground or potential debris. I'll move there and continue descending to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
