<Reasoning>I still haven't located the trash pile in any of the areas I've searched. I've now made 9 moves, which is the maximum allowed according to the limitations. From what I can see, the area contains pavement, trees, umbrellas, and some pedestrian areas, but no large trash pile is visible.</Reasoning>
