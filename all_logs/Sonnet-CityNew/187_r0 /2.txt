<Reasoning>From this lower altitude of 24 meters, I can see what appears to be some construction or road work in the diagonal strip running through the image. I need to get even lower and position myself directly above it to confirm. I'll move slightly to ensure I'm centered over what appears to be the construction area and decrease altitude to get below 10 meters.</Reasoning>
