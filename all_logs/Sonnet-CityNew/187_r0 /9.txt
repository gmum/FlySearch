<Reasoning>This is my last allowed move, and I'm still not able to safely get below 10 meters altitude. The urban environment with tall buildings and structures has made it impossible to safely achieve the mission objective of getting below 10 meters while maintaining visual contact with the construction site. I'll make one final attempt to get a better view while maintaining safe clearance.</Reasoning>
