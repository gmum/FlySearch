<Reasoning>I apologize for the unsafe maneuver. From this view at 18 meters, I can see what appears to be a construction or work site with concrete surface. I need to maintain a safer distance while still getting below 10 meters. I'll make a smaller altitude adjustment this time, moving down by 9 meters which should put me at 9 meters altitude - safely below 10 meters but not dangerously close to any structures.</Reasoning>
