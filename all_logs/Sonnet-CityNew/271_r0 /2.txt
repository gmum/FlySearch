Now I have a clearer view of the rooftop surface, which appears to be covered in gravel or similar material. I need to maintain a safe altitude while searching for any anomalies. Looking at the surface, I should continue my systematic search but with a more conservative descent. I'll move slightly to examine a different section of the roof while gradually decreasing altitude.
