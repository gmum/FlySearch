I keep getting emergency stops which suggests there might be invisible safety boundaries or restrictions I can't see. Since I'm still at 58 meters and haven't been able to descend or move effectively, let me try moving to a completely different area of the rooftop to see if I can find a safer approach path or spot the anomaly from a different angle.
