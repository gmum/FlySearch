I keep getting emergency stops, which suggests I need to be much more conservative with my altitude changes. The gravel rooftop appears to have some kind of linear feature or seam running through it. Since I'm still quite high at 58 meters, I'll try a very minimal descent this time while staying in the same horizontal position to continue examining this area.
