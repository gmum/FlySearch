<Reasoning>
I've exhausted my allowed moves and was unable to successfully get closer to the rooftop or identify any clear anomaly. The emergency stops suggest there might have been safety restrictions or invisible obstacles preventing closer inspection. Without being able to get below 10 meters as required or clearly identify an anomaly, I cannot declare "FOUND". The mission was unsuccessful.
