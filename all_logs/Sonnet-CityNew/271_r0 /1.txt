I see I'm over what appears to be a beige/brown rooftop surface. I need to be more careful with my descent to avoid collisions. I can now see more detail of the rooftop, and I should look for any anomalies. I'll move towards the center of this rooftop area and descend more gradually this time to get a better look at any potential objects that might be out of place.
