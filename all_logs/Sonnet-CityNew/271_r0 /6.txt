I now see a clear contrast between two different colored areas of the rooftop - one light and one dark. This stark difference could be what I'm looking for, or it could help identify where the anomaly might be. Let me try moving to a position where I can get a better view of where these two areas meet, while maintaining the current altitude since descending has been problematic.
