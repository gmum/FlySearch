From this high altitude of 99 meters, I can see an overview of the area which appears to be an urban environment with buildings. I notice what looks like a rooftop with light-colored or beige material that stands out from the darker buildings around it. I need to descend to get a better look at the area, particularly focusing on the eastern side where this different-colored rooftop is located. I'll move slightly towards the east and descend to get a better view of any potential anomalies.
