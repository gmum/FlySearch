I've made multiple attempts to move and descend but keep getting emergency stops. I've also noticed the stark contrast between light and dark areas of the gravel rooftop and some linear features. Since I've used 9 moves already and haven't been able to effectively search or get closer to any potential anomalies, I need to conclude this attempt. I wasn't able to get below 10 meters or definitively identify the anomaly, so I cannot declare "FOUND".
