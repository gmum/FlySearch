<Reasoning>I can see an urban intersection with a yellow crosswalk pattern. From this height, I can't clearly identify any anomalies, so I need to get lower to conduct a proper search. I'll start by descending to about 30 meters while staying centered on the intersection, as this will give me a better view while maintaining good situational awareness.</Reasoning>
