<Reasoning>I can now clearly see an aircraft/plane parked on the street, which is definitely an anomaly in an urban environment. It appears to be centered around (-5, -5) coordinates. I'll move to center directly over it and descend to 8 meters to get within the required 10-meter height requirement while keeping it in view.</Reasoning>
