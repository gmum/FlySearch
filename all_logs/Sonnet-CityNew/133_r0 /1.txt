<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see more details of the area. I notice what might be some debris or trash collection in the lower left quadrant of the image. I'll move towards that area (around -42, -42) and continue descending to get a closer look. I'll reduce altitude by another 30 meters to get a better view of what's on the ground.</Reasoning>
