<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a large open area with buildings, roads, and parking lots. Since I'm searching for a trash pile, I should systematically search the visible area. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view of any potential trash piles. Moving to coordinate (0,0) and descending 30 meters seems like a good first move to get a better overview while maintaining enough height to spot potential targets.</Reasoning>
