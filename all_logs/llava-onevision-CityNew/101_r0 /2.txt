<Reasoning>I will continue moving slightly to the east and slightly lower my altitude. I will also look for any large objects on the ground that could be the trash pile. If I find it, I will make sure I am at most 10 meters above it before responding with "FOUND". If I don't find it, I will continue the search in a grid pattern.</Reasoning>
