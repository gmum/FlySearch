<Reasoning>After moving to the north and going lower, I can now see a pile of debris on the roof. This pile of debris is not consistent with the rest of the environment, making it an anomaly. I will now fly closer to it to confirm it as the object in question.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Since I have found the object and it is indeed an anomaly, I will now fly below 10 meters relative to it and reply with "FOUND".</Reasoning>
