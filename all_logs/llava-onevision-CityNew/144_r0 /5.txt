<Reasoning>I have reached a lower altitude, and I'm currently centered over what appears to be a street. I don't see any obvious signs of a fire yet, but I should continue scanning this area more thoroughly. Given the grid, I will move slightly to the right (towards the (3, -3) point) and maintain my altitude of 10 meters above ground level.</Reasoning>
