<Reasoning>Considering the grid layout and the objective to find an anomaly, I will first attempt to move towards the center of the image to get a better view of the area. I will then descend to get closer to the ground level, as the object is likely to be found there. If the object is not visible at this position, I will continue to search systematically.</Reasoning>
