<Reasoning>Given that I am still at a safe altitude, I will continue to move slightly to the right to expand my search area and increase the chances of finding the white pickup truck. I will avoid going too far to the right to stay within the search area limits. I must be careful not to exceed the maximum altitude or go outside the 400x400m search area.</Reasoning>
