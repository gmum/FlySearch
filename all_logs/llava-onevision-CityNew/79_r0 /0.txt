<Reasoning>Given that I am searching for a large trash pile, it could potentially be located in a less frequented area, such as a side street or alleyway. I will start by moving to a position that provides a view of the side streets adjacent to the main road, as indicated by the coordinates (-24, -24). This will allow me to scan for any large, irregular objects that might be the trash pile without obstructing traffic or pedestrian pathways.</Reasoning>
