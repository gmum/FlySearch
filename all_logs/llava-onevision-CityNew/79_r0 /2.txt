<Reasoning>Upon descending closer to the rooftop, it's apparent that the large pile I identified is indeed the trash pile I was tasked to find. It is centered in my field of view and I am within the required 10 meters above it. I have double-checked the object's size and composition to confirm its identity as the trash pile. I will now report the finding.</Reasoning>
