<Reasoning>From the current vantage point, I can observe a large, irregular pile on the building's rooftop. It appears to be a substantial accumulation of objects, which could potentially be the trash pile I'm looking for. To confirm this, I need to descend closer to the object on the rooftop to inspect it further. I will position myself directly above the object at a lower altitude to ensure it is in my field of view and to get a better perspective of its size and composition. If it proves to be the trash pile, I will report it as found.</Reasoning>
