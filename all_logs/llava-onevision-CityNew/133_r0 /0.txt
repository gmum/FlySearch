<Reasoning>Given the grid and the objective, it seems that the search area is limited to the visible coordinates. I will start by moving towards the center of the grid, which is at (0, 0), and decrease my altitude to get a better view of the ground. If I don't find the object at this central point, I will expand my search to the surrounding areas, moving in a systematic pattern to cover as much ground as possible without exceeding the altitude limit or the 9 move limit.</Reasoning>
