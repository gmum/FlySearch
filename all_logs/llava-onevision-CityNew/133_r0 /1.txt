<Reasoning>Given that I am now at a lower altitude and have a clear view of the roof, I will move towards the center of the roof to get a better look at the potential object. If I see something that resembles a large trash pile, I will descend further to ensure it is the correct object and then report with "FOUND". If I don't see anything, I will continue to search methodically, moving from one section of the roof to another.</Reasoning>
