<Reasoning>Based on the objective, I need to find a fire. Since the fire would likely be in a building or on the ground, I will start by checking the central part of the image which seems to have a building with a flat roof. I will move towards the center of the image, slightly to the north, to get a better view of the building's roof and surrounding area.</Reasoning>
