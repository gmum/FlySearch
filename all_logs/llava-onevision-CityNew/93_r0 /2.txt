<Reasoning>Upon closer inspection, I can see a small amount of smoke coming from the building's roof near the center of the image. This is likely the fire that I was tasked to find. I need to move slightly closer to the building to confirm the presence of the fire and to get a better view of the situation. I will also slightly move to the west to get a better angle.</Reasoning>
