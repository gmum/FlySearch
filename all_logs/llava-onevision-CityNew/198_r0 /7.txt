<Reasoning>The UAV executed an emergency stop, indicating a proximity to an obstacle. Given the urban environment and the grid coordinates, the obstacle is likely a building or a street feature such as a crosswalk. To continue the search for the trash pile and avoid further collisions, I will slightly move east to gain a better viewpoint and then descend to a lower altitude. This movement will help in navigating around potential obstacles while continuing the search.</Reasoning>
