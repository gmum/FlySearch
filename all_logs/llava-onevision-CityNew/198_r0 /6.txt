<Reasoning>The UAV executed an emergency stop to prevent a collision, indicating the presence of an obstacle close to its current position. Given the urban environment and the grid coordinates, it's likely that the obstacle is a building or a structure on the street. To continue the search for the trash pile and avoid further collisions, I will move slightly to the east to gain a better viewpoint and then descend to a lower altitude. This movement will help in navigating around potential obstacles while continuing the search.</Reasoning>
