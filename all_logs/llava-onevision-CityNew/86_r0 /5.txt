<Reasoning>At this altitude, I can clearly see the street intersection but there is no crowd visible. I will descend slightly and move towards the center of the intersection to continue the search for the crowd. The objective is to find the crowd and be as close to it as possible without exceeding the 10 meters above it.</Reasoning>
