<Reasoning>At this altitude, I can see the street intersection clearly. However, there is no crowd visible in the image. I will continue the search for the crowd by moving towards the center of the intersection and adjusting the altitude slightly. The objective is to find the crowd and be as close to it as possible without exceeding the 10 meters above it.</Reasoning>
