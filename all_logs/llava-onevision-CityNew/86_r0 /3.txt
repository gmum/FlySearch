<Reasoning>At this lower altitude, I can more clearly see the area in the center of the image. However, I do not see a crowd in my current field of view. I will move slightly and adjust the altitude to continue the search for the crowd. The objective is to be as low as possible to the potential crowd location.</Reasoning>
