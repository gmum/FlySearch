<Reasoning>Given the starting position, I will begin by making a systematic search pattern, moving from one side of the grid to the other in a northward direction, starting from the left side. I will look out for any visible signs of smoke or fire, and also be aware of any shadows or areas that might hide the fire. If I don't see anything in this first move, I will continue to the next segment.</Reasoning>
