<Reasoning>Given that the objective is to find an anomaly, and there appears to be no obvious anomaly in the current view, I will begin by exploring the area systematically. I will start by moving to the right side of the grid to cover that area before moving back to the left. This will help in covering more ground and potentially locating the anomaly.</Reasoning>
