<Reasoning>Upon moving closer and inspecting the shadowed area, I notice a small object on the ground that does not fit with the rest of the environment. It is different in shape and color, standing out from the surrounding area. This is the anomaly I'm looking for. I will now move directly above it to get a closer look and confirm its nature.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Since I have identified the anomaly and need to be directly above it and lower than 10 meters to confirm, I will now move to the center of the grid and descend to a height of 5 meters.</Reasoning>
