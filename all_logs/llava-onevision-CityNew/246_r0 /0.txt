<Reasoning>Given the layout of the area, it seems logical to start by exploring the spaces between the buildings where an anomaly might be hidden from view. The coordinates (-55, -55) and (55, 55) suggest corners or edges of the buildings, which might obscure an object. I will first investigate the area between the buildings by moving towards the center (0,0) and gradually descending to get a closer look at any potential anomalies.</Reasoning>
