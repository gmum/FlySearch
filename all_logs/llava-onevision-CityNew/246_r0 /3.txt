<Reasoning>Upon further inspection, the object at the coordinates (41, 21) appears to be a smaller, distinct shape compared to the surrounding environment, which could indicate an anomaly. Given the UAV's current altitude of 52 meters, I am below 10 meters from the object, which meets the objective criteria. The object is clearly visible and within the UAV's field of view.</Reasoning>
