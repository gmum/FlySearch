<Reasoning>Given the lack of visible anomalies from the current altitude, I will continue to descend to improve visibility. The lower altitude will allow for a more detailed inspection of the area, particularly the shadows and less visible corners between the buildings. I will move slightly to the north to cover more ground and maintain a systematic search pattern.</Reasoning>
