<Reasoning>At the current altitude, a potential anomaly is visible at the coordinates (41, 21). To investigate further, I will move towards this point and descend to get a closer look. The object appears to be a smaller, distinct shape compared to the surrounding environment, which could indicate an anomaly. Moving closer will help confirm whether it is indeed the object we are looking for.</Reasoning>
