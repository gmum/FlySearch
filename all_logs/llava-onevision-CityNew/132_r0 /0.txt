<Reasoning>Given the objective, I need to find a large trash pile and get within 10 meters of it. The grid shows that I should move towards the yellow squares to start the search. Since the trash pile is likely to be on the ground, I will start by searching the yellow square nearest to me and then move to the others if necessary. I will begin by moving to the yellow square at (0,0) and adjust my altitude to 10 meters to meet the objective requirement.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -41)</Action>

If the trash pile is not in the first yellow square, I will continue to search the other yellow squares in a systematic manner, adjusting my altitude as needed to maintain the 10-meter requirement. For example:

<Reasoning>The trash pile was not in the first yellow square. I will now move to the next yellow square at (17,0) and adjust my altitude to 10 meters.</Reasoning>
<Action>(17, 0, -34)</Action>

<Reasoning>The trash pile was not in the second yellow square either. I will continue this process until I find the trash pile.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I have found the trash pile in the yellow square at (34,0). I am now at an altitude of 10 meters above the object.</Reasoning>
