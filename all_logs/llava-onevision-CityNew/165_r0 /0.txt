<Reasoning> I should perform a systematic search by moving in a grid pattern. I will start by moving to the center of the grid (0,0) and then move in a spiral pattern outwards while gradually decreasing my altitude to get a better view of the ground.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0,0,0)</Action>

<Reasoning> I have arrived at the center of the grid. Now I will move to the next point on the grid while decreasing my altitude. I will move to (-20,0) and decrease my altitude by 10 meters.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-20,0,-10)</Action>

<Reasoning> I have arrived at (-20,0) and decreased my altitude. Now I will move to the next point on the grid while decreasing my altitude. I will move to (-20,-20) and decrease my altitude by 10 meters.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-20,-20,-10)</Action>

<Reasoning> I have arrived at (-20,-20) and decreased my altitude. Now I will move to the next point on the grid while decreasing my altitude. I will move to (0,-20) and decrease my altitude by 10 meters.</Reasoning>
