<Reasoning>The image shows a complex urban environment with buildings, roads, and intersections. The anomaly might be a distinct object or pattern that doesn't fit with the rest of the scene.

Now, I will move to (0, -32) to cover the bottom part of the grid and look for any unusual features.</Reasoning>
