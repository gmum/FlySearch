<Reasoning>Given the search area and the need to find an anomaly, I will first perform a general sweep of the area by moving to different points along the grid. Starting from the central point (0, 0) and moving systematically, I will begin by moving to (-32, 0) to cover the left side of the grid. If the object is not visible at this point, I will adjust my altitude and position accordingly to continue the search.</Reasoning>
