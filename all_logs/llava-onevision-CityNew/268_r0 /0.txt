<Reasoning>Given the grid and the objective to find an anomaly, I will first move to the center of the grid to get a better view of the area. From there, I can assess if there is any object that stands out from the surroundings.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>Now that I'm at the center and slightly lower, I can see a yellow square on the grid which seems out of place. This might be the object we're looking for. I will move closer to investigate.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>As I move closer, I can confirm that the yellow square is indeed an anomaly. It's not part of the building structure and appears to be an object placed on the ground. I am now below 10 meters relative to the object and it is in my field of view.</Reasoning>
