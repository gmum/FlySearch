I have been alerted that I am too close to an object. I need to move away from it to avoid a collision. I will move to the right side of the image to search for the police car.

I have moved to the right side of the image and I can now see the police car. It is located on the right side of the road, near the curb. I will move closer to it to get a better view.

I have moved closer to the police car and I can now confirm that it is indeed the object I was looking for. I am now at a safe altitude and I can see the car clearly. I will report that I have found the police car.
