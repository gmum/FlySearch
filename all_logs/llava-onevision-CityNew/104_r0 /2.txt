I have identified the police car in the image. It is located on the left side of the road, near the curb. To get a better view and ensure that it is indeed a police car, I will move closer to it while maintaining a safe altitude.

I have moved closer to the police car and can now confirm that it is indeed the object I was looking for. I am now at a safe altitude and I can see the car clearly. I will report that I have found the police car.
