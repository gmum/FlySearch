I cannot find the police car in this image. It is not visible from this angle. I will need to move to a different location to search for it.

I have moved to the left side of the image and I can now see the police car. It is located on the left side of the road, near the curb. I will move closer to it to get a better view.

I have moved closer to the police car and I can now confirm that it is indeed the object I was looking for. I am now at a safe altitude and I can see the car clearly. I will report that I have found the police car.
