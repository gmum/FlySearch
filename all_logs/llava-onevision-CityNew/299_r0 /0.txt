<Reasoning>Considering the distribution of points in the image, it seems that there are two areas with higher concentrations of points towards the center-left and center-right. I will first investigate the center-left area as it appears to have a denser cluster. If the object is not there, I will move to the center-right area for further investigation.</Reasoning>
