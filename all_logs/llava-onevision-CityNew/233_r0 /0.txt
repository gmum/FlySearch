<Reasoning>Given the task is to find an anomaly, I should start by scanning the area for anything that stands out. The grid indicates that moving towards (32, 64) and (64, 64) will bring me closer to the top of the building, which could potentially reveal more of the environment. Since the object might be hidden from view or located at a height, I will first ascend slightly to get a better overview before descending.</Reasoning>
