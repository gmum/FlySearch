<Reasoning>As I got closer to the site, I can confirm that it is indeed the road construction site. The yellow vehicle is parked next to the construction area, and there are cones set up around it. I will now maintain this altitude and observe the site for further instructions.</Reasoning>
No action needed as the object has been found and the altitude is within the acceptable range.
