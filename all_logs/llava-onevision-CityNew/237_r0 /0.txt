<Reasoning>Given the image and the objective to find an anomaly, I need to observe changes in patterns or objects that don't fit the surrounding environment. The grid indicates the drone's field of vision, and I should move to a position where the object would be centered in the field of view. I will start by moving to the center of the image and then adjust the altitude to get closer to the object. If the object is not visible from the center, I will move closer to the grid points that seem to have a high likelihood of containing the anomaly.</Reasoning>
