<Reasoning>After moving to the right and slightly lowering the altitude, I can now see that the anomaly is a large yellow object floating on the water. It is located at the grid point (0, -36). This object stands out due to its size and color, which is unusual for the surrounding environment. I will now fly below 10 meters above the object to confirm it as the anomaly.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>  <!-- Move down 10 meters, keeping the same x and y coordinates to center the object in the field of view. -->
