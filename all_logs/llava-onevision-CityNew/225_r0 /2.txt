<Reasoning>Upon reviewing the area, I notice an object that appears to be out of place on the rooftop at coordinates (31, -31). It seems to be an anomaly compared to the rest of the rooftop structure. I will move to a lower altitude to confirm this observation.</Reasoning>

FOUND. The object is at coordinates (31, -31) and is visible. I am currently 10 meters above it.
