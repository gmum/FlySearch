<Reasoning>As I move towards the center of the grid, I notice a potential fire at the coordinate (0, -20). To confirm if it is indeed the fire, I will move closer to the location and check for any smoke or flames.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Since I have found the fire, I will move below 10 meters above it to inspect it closely.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>It is essential to get as close as possible to the fire to assess its severity and provide accurate information. I will move to the coordinate (0, -20) and adjust my altitude to 3 meters above the fire.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>By moving to the specified coordinate and adjusting the altitude, I will be able to inspect the fire closely and provide necessary information for further action.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>After inspecting the fire, I will report it and continue any necessary operations as instructed.</Reasoning>
