<Reasoning>It seems I have encountered an obstacle and cannot proceed further in this direction. To avoid any potential damage, I will perform an emergency stop and adjust my course to continue the search for the fire.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Given the situation, I will move to the right side of the grid to continue the search for the fire. I will move to the coordinate (25, 0) to check for the fire and then continue moving along the grid if necessary.</Reasoning>
