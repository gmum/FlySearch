<Reasoning>At this altitude, I can clearly see the rooftop and some of the objects on it. The yellow car on the street also appears to be an anomaly. I will descend slightly to get a closer look at the car and the objects on the rooftop. If the car is the anomaly, I will report it. If not, I will continue the search.</Reasoning>
