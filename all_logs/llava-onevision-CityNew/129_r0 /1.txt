    I see a large pile of trash on the rooftop near the coordinates (-47, -47). I will move towards that location and lower my altitude to get a closer look.

    I have now descended to an altitude of 10 meters. I can confirm that the large pile of trash is in my field of view. I will now fly below 10 meters relative to it and reply with "FOUND".
