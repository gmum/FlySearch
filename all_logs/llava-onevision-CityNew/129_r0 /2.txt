    I apologize for the emergency stop. It appears that I have flown too close to the rooftop near the coordinates (-29, 0). I will now maintain a safe distance and adjust my altitude accordingly.

    I have adjusted my altitude to 50 meters above ground level. I will now continue to search for the trash pile in the vicinity of the rooftop.
