<Reasoning>Now that I am at a lower altitude, I can see more details. The yellow taxi and the white car are the most prominent objects in my field of view. I should focus on the white car as it seems to be the most unusual object in this urban setting. I will move slightly to the left to get a better view of the car.</Reasoning>
