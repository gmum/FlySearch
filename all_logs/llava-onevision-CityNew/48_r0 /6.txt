<Reasoning>As the fire has been reported, I will continue to monitor it from this altitude to provide updates on the situation. The fire remains on the sidewalk adjacent to the road and is contained within a small area. I will ensure that the fire remains centered in my view to provide accurate observations.</Reasoning>
