<Reasoning>Given the current altitude of 64 meters, I should continue to descend closer to the ground to enhance the visibility of potential fire-related details. At this altitude, I can still see a significant portion of the scene but I need to get even lower to inspect the ground more closely. I will adjust my position slightly to the center of the image to ensure a balanced view of the surroundings.</Reasoning>
