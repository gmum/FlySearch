<Reasoning>Now that I have a clear view and have confirmed the presence of a fire, I can report it while ensuring that the fire remains in the center of my view. I am at a sufficient altitude to avoid any obstacles while still providing a clear observation of the fire's location. I will slightly adjust my position to ensure the fire remains centered and then declare it found.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>The fire is located on the sidewalk adjacent to the road. It appears to be contained within a small area, and there is no visible smoke rising from it. I will report the fire's location and continue to monitor it from this altitude.</Reasoning>
