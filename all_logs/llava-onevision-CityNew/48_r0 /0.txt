<Reasoning>Given the objective, the search area and the current altitude, I should start by adjusting the height to ensure I can effectively perform the search. I will descend to a lower altitude, closer to the ground, to have a better view of the details on the ground that could indicate a fire. Additionally, I will slightly shift towards the center of the view to get a more comprehensive perspective.</Reasoning>
