<Reasoning>At this altitude, the buildings' rooftops and the ground are clearly visible. I need to find signs of smoke or fire which typically would be quite noticeable. I will slightly adjust my position to the left to ensure I am not missing anything on the left side of the image. I will also continue to descend to get an even closer look at the possible fire location.</Reasoning>
