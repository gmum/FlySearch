<Reasoning>I have moved slightly to the east and can now clearly see the smoke rising from the ground near the center of the image. The fire is located near the point (-12, 12) on the grid. I will move slightly downwards to get a better view of the fire while staying below 10 meters above it.</Reasoning>
