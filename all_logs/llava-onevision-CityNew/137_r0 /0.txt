<Reasoning>Since I cannot identify the object in the initial image and the objective requires me to be below 10 meters above the object, I will start by descending to a lower altitude and then begin a systematic search. I will first move to the center of the grid, which is the (0, 0) coordinate, and then adjust my altitude to 10 meters to be in line with the objective's requirements.</Reasoning>
