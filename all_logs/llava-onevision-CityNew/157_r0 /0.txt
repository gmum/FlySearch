<Reasoning>Given the objective to find a large trash pile and the grid representing possible locations, I will start by moving to the center of the grid to check if the object is visible from this position. If not, I will continue to search systematically, moving to adjacent points on the grid, reducing my altitude as I approach each point to increase the likelihood of spotting the object.</Reasoning>
