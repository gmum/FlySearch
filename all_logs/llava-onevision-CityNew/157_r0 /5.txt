<Reasoning>At this altitude, a large trash pile might be more discernible. However, the trash pile is not visible in the current view, so I will continue to move to the next point on the grid, maintaining a systematic approach. I will go to the point (18, -35) and reduce my altitude slightly to further enhance visibility of the ground below.</Reasoning>
