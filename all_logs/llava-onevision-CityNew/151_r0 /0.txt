<Reasoning>Given the context and objective, it is essential to perform a systematic search by adjusting the drone's altitude and moving in different directions based on the grid. Since there is no visible trash pile in the first image, I will start by descending to a lower altitude to cover more ground and possibly identify the object. I will begin by moving towards the center coordinates, which are (0, 0, 0) on the grid, and then adjust my altitude downward.</Reasoning>
