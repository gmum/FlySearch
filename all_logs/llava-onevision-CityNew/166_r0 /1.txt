<Reasoning>As I approach the construction site, I can see a group of workers and construction equipment gathered around. I will carefully descend to get a closer look at the site, ensuring that I am below 10 meters relative to it. I will slightly adjust my position to the west to get a better view of the entire site.</Reasoning>
