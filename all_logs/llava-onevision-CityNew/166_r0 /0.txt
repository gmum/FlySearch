<Reasoning>Given that the object is not visible in the current view, I will start by moving northward, as the construction site could potentially be in that direction. I will decrease my altitude to get a better view of the ground, as the objective requires me to be below 10 meters from the object. I will also slightly move east to cover more ground area.</Reasoning>
