<Reasoning>Since I can't see the object in the first image, I will start by moving in a grid pattern to search for it. I will begin by moving to the center of the grid, which is (0, 0) and then move down 10 meters to get a better view. If I don't find the object, I will continue to search in a systematic manner.</Reasoning>
