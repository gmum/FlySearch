<Reasoning>Continuing the search for a blue sports car, I will move slightly towards the left and slightly lower the altitude to 28 meters to gain a better view of the vehicles on the road. If the car is not visible from this position, I will continue to adjust my location, focusing on areas that are more likely to contain the car.</Reasoning>
