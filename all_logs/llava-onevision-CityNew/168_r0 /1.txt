<Reasoning>Given the emergency stop warning, it's clear that the drone has encountered an obstacle. To avoid further complications and continue the search, I will move away from the obstacle while maintaining the current altitude of 28 meters. I will ascend slightly to 30 meters to avoid any other potential obstacles. The next step will be to move towards the center of the search area to resume the search for the blue sports car. If the car is not visible from this position, I will continue to adjust my location, focusing on areas that are more likely to contain the car.</Reasoning>
