<Reasoning>From this position, I will move slightly towards the road on the left side of the image while maintaining the current altitude of 27 meters. The objective is to find a blue sports car, so I will continue to adjust my location, focusing on areas that are more likely to contain the car. If the car is not visible from this position, I will continue to move in a systematic way to cover the search area.</Reasoning>
