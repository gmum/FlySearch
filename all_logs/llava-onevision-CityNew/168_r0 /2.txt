<Reasoning>From this elevated position, I can see a yellow car on the road. However, the objective is to find a blue sports car. I will continue to search the area by moving slightly towards the center of the search area while maintaining the altitude of 30 meters. If the car is not visible from this position, I will continue to adjust my location, focusing on areas that are more likely to contain the car.</Reasoning>
