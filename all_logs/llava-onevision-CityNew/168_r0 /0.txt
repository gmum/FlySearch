<Reasoning>Given the specific requirements to find a blue sports car and the need to maintain an altitude below 10 meters above the object, I will begin by moving to a central location in the search area to gain a broader perspective. The coordinates (-18, 0) on the grid seem to be a good starting point as they are roughly in the middle of the search area. I will descend to an altitude of 10 meters to comply with the altitude requirement. If the car is not visible from this position, I will adjust my location accordingly, moving towards areas with higher likelihood of containing the car, such as roads or parking spaces.</Reasoning>
