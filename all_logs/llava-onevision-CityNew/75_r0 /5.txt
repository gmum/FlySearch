<Reasoning>It seems I have flown too close to a building or structure again. I will need to adjust my position to avoid further collisions and continue my search for the construction site. I will move away from the obstacle and slightly descend to maintain a safe altitude while searching for the construction site. I will also expand my search area to the left to see if the construction site is located there.</Reasoning>
