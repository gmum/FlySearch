<Reasoning>From the image, I can see that the blue sports car is located on the left side of the image, near the crosswalk. I will move towards the left side of the image and go down to get closer to the car. I will also slightly go to the north to make sure I am centered on the car.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Now that I have moved towards the left side of the image and gone down, I can see the blue sports car in my field of view. I am currently 10 meters above the car, which is within the required altitude. I can confirm that I have found the blue sports car.</Reasoning>
