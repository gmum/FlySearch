<Reasoning>Given that I have to find the anomaly lower than 10 meters, I need to descend. I will first go down by 30 meters and slightly move to the west to cover more ground.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-5, 0, -30)</Action>

<Reasoning>Descending to 61 meters. I should now have a better view of the ground level to spot the anomaly. I will continue to explore the area, looking for anything that stands out or doesn't fit the surroundings.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>After moving slightly to the west, I should now have a broader view of the area. I will move another 10 meters west to continue my search. If I find the anomaly, I will ensure I am at most 10 meters above it before confirming.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-10, 0, 0)</Action>

<Reasoning>Now at a lower altitude and further to the west, I should have a more comprehensive view of the area. If I spot the anomaly, I will confirm it is within my vision and at the required altitude.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Upon careful observation, I see an object that stands out from the rest of the environment. It is close to the coordinates (0,0) in the grid. I will ensure I am below 10 meters above the object before confirming FOUND.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Confirmed that
