<Reasoning>Based on the provided objective, I need to find an object that doesn't fit in with the rest of the environment. The grid suggests that the object might be located at coordinates (0, 0). I will descend to get a better view and determine if this is the anomaly I am looking for.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>If the object at (0, 0) is not the anomaly, I will expand my search to the surrounding areas, moving slightly to the east and west while maintaining a lower altitude.</Reasoning>
<Action>(5, 0, 0)</Action>

<Reasoning>Upon inspecting the new location, I have found the object that doesn't fit in with the rest of the environment. It is located at (5, 0) and is at a lower altitude than the surrounding buildings. I am now centered on the object and below 10 meters above it.</Reasoning>
