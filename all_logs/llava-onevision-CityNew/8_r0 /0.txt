<Reasoning>Given the grid and the objective, I will begin by moving towards the center of the image to get a better view of the surroundings. I will slightly descend to reduce the altitude and increase the chances of finding the object within the 10-meter threshold. If the center does not contain the object, I will continue to explore the area systematically.</Reasoning>
