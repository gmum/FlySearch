<Reasoning>After moving east and descending, the object that stands out as the anomaly is the person standing on the sidewalk near the crosswalk. This person is the anomaly because they are not moving along with the vehicles and appear to be out of place in this urban environment. I will now center on the person to ensure I am within 10 meters above them.</Reasoning>
<Reasoning>Now that I have centered on the person and am within 10 meters above them, I can confirm that this person is the anomaly. The person is standing still on the sidewalk, which contrasts with the moving vehicles around them. This is likely the object we were tasked to find.</Reasoning>
