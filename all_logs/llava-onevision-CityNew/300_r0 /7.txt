<Reasoning>It seems I have reached a fourth emergency stop due to proximity to the building edge. The anomaly, a large dark object, is still visible, and I need to maintain a safe distance to prevent further incidents. I will adjust my position slightly to avoid hitting the building while keeping the object in the center of the frame.</Reasoning>
