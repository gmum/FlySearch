<Reasoning>Upon closer inspection of the object at (-35, -35), it's clear that it is significantly different from the rest of the environment. It appears to be a large, dark object that stands out against the lighter tones of the surrounding area. This object is the anomaly we were tasked to find. I will now position the drone directly above it and descend to ensure I am no more than 10 meters above the object.</Reasoning>
