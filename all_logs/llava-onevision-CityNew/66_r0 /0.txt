<Reasoning>Given the context and objective, I should start by moving towards the center of the image, as it provides a good vantage point to search for the object. I will descend slightly to get a better view of the ground below. If the object is not visible, I will continue to search by making gradual moves towards different sections of the grid.</Reasoning>
