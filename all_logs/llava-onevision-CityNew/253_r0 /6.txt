<Reasoning>After moving to the point (0, 18), I have checked the area and there is no anomaly detected. I will continue to move along the grid, following the next point (18, 18). This will allow me to maintain a methodical search and ensure that I don't miss any potential anomaly. Once I have checked this point, I will continue to move along the grid, covering each point in turn.</Reasoning>
