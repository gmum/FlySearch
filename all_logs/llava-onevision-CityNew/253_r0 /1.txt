<Reasoning>Starting from the point (0, 0, 0), I will systematically move to the next point on the grid, which is (-29, 0). This will allow me to cover the area in a methodical pattern and ensure that I don't miss any potential anomaly. Once I have checked this point, I will continue to move along the grid, covering each point in turn. This will help me to maintain a thorough and organized search.</Reasoning>
