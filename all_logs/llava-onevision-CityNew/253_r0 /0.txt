<Reasoning>Given the grid, I need to start by covering the area systematically. I will start by moving to the nearest point on the grid, which is (0, 0, 0), and then I will begin to scan the area by moving along the grid in a methodical manner. I will start by moving to (0, 0, 0) and then proceed to check the points around it, moving in a systematic pattern to ensure thorough coverage.</Reasoning>
