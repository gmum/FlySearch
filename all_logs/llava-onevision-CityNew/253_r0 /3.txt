<Reasoning>It appears that I have flown too close to a building and would have hit it. This is not ideal as it could result in damage to the drone. To avoid this, I will need to adjust my flight path and maintain a safe distance from any obstacles. I will move to a higher altitude to ensure that I have enough clearance and can continue the search without any issues.</Reasoning>
