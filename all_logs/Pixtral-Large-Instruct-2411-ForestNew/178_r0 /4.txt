    I am at 14 meters above ground level and there appears to be a structure located at approximately (5, -5) in the image. This is potentially the building I am tasked to find. I will move towards it and adjust my altitude to be precisely below 10 meters above it for confirmation.

    The building is directly below the drone, and I am less than 10 meters above it. The objective is completed.
