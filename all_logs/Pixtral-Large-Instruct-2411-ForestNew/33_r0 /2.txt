<Reasoning>The object in the center of the vision at coordinates (6, 6) looks like a trash pile. The drone is currently at 18 meters above ground level, so I will lower the altitude to be below 10 meters to meet the objective.</Reasoning>
<Action>(6, 6, -10)</Action>
```
After this move, if the drone is centered on the trash pile and below 10 meters above it, I will reply with "FOUND".
