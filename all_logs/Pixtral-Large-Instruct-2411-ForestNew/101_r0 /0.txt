    The current view shows a dense forested area with no immediate signs of a trash pile. To systematically search the area, I will move in a grid pattern while gradually decreasing altitude. This will help ensure that any trash piles in the vicinity are spotted. I will start by moving northeast and decreasing altitude to get a closer look at the ground.
