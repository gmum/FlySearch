 <Reasoning>Given the repeated issues with descending too close to the airplane, I will make a very minimal descent of 1 meter to ensure I am safely within the required 10 meters while maintaining a central position over the object.</Reasoning>

This move should place me at approximately 11 meters above the airplane.

If this altitude is safe and the object remains centered, I can then proceed with a final 1-meter descent to reach the required 10-meter threshold and declare "FOUND".
