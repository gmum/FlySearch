<Reasoning>I'm currently at an altitude of 81 meters. To better examine the area and look for any anomalies, I will decrease my altitude and move towards a location with potential objects of interest. The coordinates (0, -27) have a yellow spot that could be worth investigating. I will descend and move towards that area.</Reasoning>
