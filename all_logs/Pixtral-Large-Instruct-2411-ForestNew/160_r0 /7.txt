 Great! You have successfully located the object. Here is the summary of the search process:

1. Moved from (0, 0, 77) to (26, -26, 57).
2. Moved from (26, -26, 57) to (19, -19, 37).
3. Moved from (19, -19, 37) to (0, -25, 22).
4. Moved from (0, -25, 22) to (7, -15, 17).
5. Moved from (7, -15, 17) to (6, 6, 7).
6. Moved from (6, 6, 7) to (0, -5, 7).
7. Moved from (0, -5, 7) to (0, -2, 7).

At this point, you identified the person at coordinates (0, -2) and were flying at an altitude of 7 meters, which is within the 10-meter requirement. The person was in your field of view and centered on the drone's vision.

Well done! You have completed the task successfully.
