 From the current image, it is clear that the object at the center (0,0) is indeed an anomaly, distinct from the surrounding foliage. Given the altitude and visibility in this image, we can confirm it is the object of interest.

Since I am already centered on the object at an altitude of 8 meters, the object is within the required range.

FOUND.
