    I am very close to the ground now. I will move to coordinates (6, -11) to investigate an area with more vegetation, which might reveal the object I'm looking for.

**Note:** Aiming to get closer to the ground to ensure a clear view of potential objects; hence, only descending 5 meters to maintain a safe search altitude.
