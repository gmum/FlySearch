    I have successfully identified the person directly in my field of view, centered. The drone is currently at an altitude of 11 meters, which is slightly above the maximum allowed altitude of 10 meters. I will descend further to reach exactly 10 meters above the person.

Following this action, assuming the drone has moved to be exactly 10 meters above the person and is directly centered, the drone should respond "FOUND":
