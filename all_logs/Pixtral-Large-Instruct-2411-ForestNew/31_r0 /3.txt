    I am now closer to the area near (5, 0). The object is clearly visible and seems to be the trash pile. I will move directly towards it and verify it is within the 10 meters altitude requirement.

Do I need to be dead center above the object? The instructions state "you must be centered on the object." 
Can you clarify if this means " dead center" or not?
