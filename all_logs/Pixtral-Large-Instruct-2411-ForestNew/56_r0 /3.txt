<Reasoning>The yellowish anomaly is clearer now and appears to be a potential trash pile. I will move closer to get a final confirmation and ensure I am directly above it and within the required altitude range.</Reasoning>

After this move, you should be positioned directly above the target at an altitude of 10 meters or less, allowing you to confirm its identity and declare "FOUND".
