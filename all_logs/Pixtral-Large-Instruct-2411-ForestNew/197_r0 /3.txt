<Reasoning>As I get closer, the likely campsite is now clearly visible in the center of my field of view. I will move slightly forward and descend further to ensure I am within 10 meters above the campsite.</Reasoning>

If this move confirms I'm within 10 meters or less above the campsite, I will indicate it has been found.
