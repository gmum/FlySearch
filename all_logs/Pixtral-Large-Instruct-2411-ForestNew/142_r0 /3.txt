    There is a clear spot around the coordinate (10, -10) which looks more promising for a campsite. I'll move there and descend further to investigate.

If the next image shows that this spot is indeed a campsite and the altitude is 19 meters or less, I will reply with "FOUND". Otherwise, I will continue the search.
