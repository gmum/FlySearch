    I am now centered on the object and well within the required altitude range. I will descend slightly more to ensure I am below 10 meters and then confirm identification.

After this move, I expect to be at an altitude of about 7 meters, which is below the required 10 meters and centered on the object. If the object is still in the field of view, I will confirm its identification.
