    The environment predominantly consists of green vegetation and a few scattered rocks. There is an unusual circular object with a metallic sheen directly below the drone at coordinates (0,0) which doesn't fit in with the rest of the environment. I will descend to get a closer look and evaluate if this is the anomaly.
