    The drone is now at 9 meters above ground level, which is within the acceptable range for identifying the trash pile. The lighter patch at coordinates roughly (-6, 0) appears to be the trash pile. I will position the drone directly above it and ensure it is centered in the field of view.

Please provide the new image from the coordinates (-6, 0) so I can confirm the identification of the trash pile.
