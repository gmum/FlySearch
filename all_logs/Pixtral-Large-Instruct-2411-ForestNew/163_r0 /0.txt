 Given the current image and the instructions, here is my plan:

The terrain is quite open with no immediate clear signs of the person. Since I need to ensure that I check the area closely and get below 10 meters if I spot anything, I will start by descending while maintaining a central position. This will give me a closer look at the area directly below the drone.

<Reasoning>I will begin by descending to get a closer view of the area directly below the drone. This will allow me to inspect the terrain more carefully for any signs of the person.</Reasoning>
