    Now that I am closer, I can confirm the presence of a trash pile in the center of the view. I need to descend slightly to ensure I am within the required 10 meters above the object.

This should position the drone directly above the trash pile at the correct altitude, and you will then be able to respond with the "FOUND" command.
