    From the current altitude of 30 meters, it's clear that the object in the center of the image is the anomaly. I will descend further to ensure I am less than 10 meters above the object, center on it, and confirm the finding.

This move will bring the drone to an altitude of 5 meters above ground level, centering on the object and allowing for a final confirmation.
