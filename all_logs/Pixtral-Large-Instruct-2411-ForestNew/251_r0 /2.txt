    After descending further, I am now at 40 meters above ground level. The object in the center of the image appears to be an anomaly, as it doesn't fit in with the surrounding environment. I will move closer to this object to investigate further.

This move will bring the drone to an altitude of 30 meters above ground level and closer to the central object, allowing for a clearer inspection to confirm whether it is indeed the anomaly.
