    The altitude is now 30 meters. The person is still not visible in the current field of view. I will move closer to the area near coordinates (0, 0) and descend further to inspect more closely. This area seems to have some potentially interesting features.

This move should place the drone at 20 meters altitude and considerably closer to any person who might be hidden by the trees or other obstacles visible in the image. If the person is not visible from this vantage point, further repositioning and descending may be necessary.
