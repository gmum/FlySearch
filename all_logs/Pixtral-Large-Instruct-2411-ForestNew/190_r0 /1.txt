<Reasoning>The red area on the left looks like a potential forest fire. I will move closer to (-31, 0) and lower my altitude to get a clearer view. </Reasoning>
<Action>(-31, 0, -20)</Action>

I'll wait for the next image to assess whether the potential forest fire is indeed present and whether it is within the required 10 meters below the drone.
