<Reasoning>The object at coordinates (6, 0) is now more visible and appears to be the trash pile I am looking for. I will approach it and position the drone directly above it at a height of less than 10 meters to confirm and report.</Reasoning>
<Action>(6, 0, -9)</Action>
```

If the drone reaches the desired height and position in the next move, it should report "FOUND" upon seeing the trash pile clearly centered and at an altitude of 10 meters or less above the object.
