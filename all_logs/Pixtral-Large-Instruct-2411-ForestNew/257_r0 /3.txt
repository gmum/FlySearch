    I am now at 25 meters above ground level. The white object in the center of the grid is more clearly visible and stands out from the surrounding environment. I will center more precisely on this object and descend further to ensure I'm within 10 meters of it for a closer inspection.

This movement should place the drone directly above the object and within the necessary altitude range for a more detailed examination.
