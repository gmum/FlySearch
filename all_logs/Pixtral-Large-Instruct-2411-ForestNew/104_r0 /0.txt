    The image shows an area with various terrain and vegetation. There doesn't seem to be an obvious trash pile in the center of the view. To begin the search, I will move slightly to the north and lower the altitude to get a closer look at the ground. This will help in identifying potential targets and improving the visibility of any trash piles that might be present.
