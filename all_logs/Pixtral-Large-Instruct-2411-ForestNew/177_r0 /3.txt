 Based on the image, the potential fire is at (0, -1) but I am at an altitude of 3 meters, which is below the required 10 meters. Therefore, I'll ascend to the correct height.

```xml
<Reasoning>I need to ascend to ensure I am above 10 meters from the ground to comply with the requirements for confirming the forest fire.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, -1, 7)</Action>
