    Since I am currently at 91 meters above ground level, I will first descend to get closer to the potential objects on the ground while staying within the altitude constraints. The image shows a dense forest area with a clearing that looks like a potential location for a building. I will move towards that clearing slightly to the right while descending to get a better look.
