    Now that I have descended closer to the ground, I notice an interesting object in the form of a blue circle right at the center of the image, coordinates (0, 0). The area around it is largely clear, which makes this circular object stand out as a potential anomaly. I will descend further while ensuring I maintain a central position relative to this object.
