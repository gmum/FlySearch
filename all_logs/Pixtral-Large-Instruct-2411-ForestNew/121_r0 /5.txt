    The patch at (7, -7) now looks very much like a trash pile. I will adjust my position to directly above it while lowering my altitude to the required 10 meters or less, ensuring it is centered in the field of view.

This move will bring the UAV directly above the trash pile and at the required altitude. The next step will be to confirm the identification.
