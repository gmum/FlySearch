    I have moved to the northwest corner while maintaining altitude. There appears to be a patch of ground that looks different from the surrounding area at approximately (-18, 18). I will inspect this area more closely by lowering the altitude.

This move will bring the UAV close to the suspected location of the trash pile, allowing for a more detailed inspection.
