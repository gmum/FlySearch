    I have moved closer to the area of interest and lowered the altitude to 40 meters. The patch at (13, 13) looks like it could be the trash pile. I will move closer to it and descend further to ensure it is within the required 10 meters.

This move should bring the UAV very close to the suspected trash pile, allowing for a clearer identification.
