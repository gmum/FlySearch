 ```xml
<Reasoning>At this altitude, I can start looking for anomalies more effectively. I will move to the grid point (25, 25) to explore the upper-right section of the environment while also descending further to ensure I'm within the required altitude when I find the object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(25, 25, -15)</Action>
```

I noticed an object at the current location that appears to be out of place in the natural environment. I will descend further to inspect it closely and verify if it is the anomaly.

```xml
<Reasoning>I have spotted an object that doesn't fit the natural surroundings. I will descend to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>
```

If the object is still in view and fits the criteria, the next step will be to respond with "FOUND".
