    I can see what appears to be a trash pile at coordinates (-13, -13). I will move towards this point and descend further to 10 meters above ground level for a closer inspection.

If at this point the object is identified correctly in the center of your view and you're below 10 meters above it, you will proceed with the "FOUND" response.
