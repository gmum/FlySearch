    I am now closer to the possible anomaly. To get a detailed inspection, I will move directly above it and descend further to ensure the altitude is below 10 meters relative to the object.

This move should position the drone directly above the object, descending closer for a clear view. If the object is indeed the anomaly and within the specified conditions, the next response will be "FOUND."
