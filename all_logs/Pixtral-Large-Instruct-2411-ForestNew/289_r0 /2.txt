    I have moved to a new quadrant, and still, no anomalies have been detected. I will continue my search pattern by moving north-east to cover more area.

Your next move:
```xml
<Reasoning>
    After exploring the north-east, south-west, and north-west quadrants, I will now explore the south-east quadrant to ensure a thorough search.

<Action>(18, -18, 0)</Action>
```

If no anomaly is detected after this move, the search pattern will continue in a systematic manner to cover all areas effectively.
