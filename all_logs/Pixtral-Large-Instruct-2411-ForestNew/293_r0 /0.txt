 To systematically search for the anomaly, I'll start by moving in a pattern to cover the area efficiently. My first move will be to the grid point (0, 45) and descend to get a closer look at any potential objects in that direction.

<Reasoning>I will start the search by moving to the grid point (0, 45) and descending to 47 meters above ground level. This will allow me to cover more area and get a closer look at any potential anomalies in that direction.</Reasoning>
