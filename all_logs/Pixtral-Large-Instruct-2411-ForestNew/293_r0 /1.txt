 The image shows a lot of trees and vegetation. Given the environment, the anomaly could be something that stands out from this natural setting. I will move closer to a point where there seems to be a small clearing or disturbance in the vegetation, which might indicate the presence of an anomaly. I'll move to (15, 0) and descend slightly to get a better view.

<Reasoning>There appears to be a small clearing or disturbance in the vegetation near (15, 0). I will move closer to this point and descend slightly to get a better view of the area and check for any anomalies.</Reasoning>
