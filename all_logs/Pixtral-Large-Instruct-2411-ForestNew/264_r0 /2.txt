    At this altitude, more details of the forest floor are becoming visible. There is a distinct structure at coordinates (-12, 12) that looks unusual compared to the surrounding trees and foliage. It may be the anomaly we are searching for. I will proceed to lower the altitude further while centering on this potential anomaly to confirm it.
