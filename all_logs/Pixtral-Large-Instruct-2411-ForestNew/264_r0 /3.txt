    The structure at coordinates (-13, 6) looks quite distinct from the surrounding environment, and it could very well be the anomaly we are searching for. I will move closer and center the drone directly above it to confirm.

**Note: The object is already in the center of the vision field, so no need to move right or left, only going down is enough.**

Then, I will confirm the object.

    The object is now clearly visible and centered in my field of view. It's not part of the natural forest environment. I am now 9 meters above the object and will confirm its location.
