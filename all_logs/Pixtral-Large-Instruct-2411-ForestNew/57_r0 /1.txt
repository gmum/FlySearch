    The altitude is still relatively high at 50 meters, so it's possible that the trash pile is not visible yet. I will descend further to get closer to the ground. The area below still needs to be inspected, so maintaining a systematic search pattern while descending is important. I'll move downwards and slightly to the south to continue the search.
