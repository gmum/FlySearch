    As the current altitude is 70 meters above ground level, the trash pile, if present, might not be immediately visible. I need to descend to get a closer look at the area below. This will help in identifying any potential trash piles that may be obscured by the current altitude. I will move downwards while also slightly adjusting my position to explore more of the area.
