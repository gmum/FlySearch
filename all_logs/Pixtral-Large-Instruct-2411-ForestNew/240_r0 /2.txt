<Reasoning>The object is now centralized within my field of view. I need to descend further to be within the required 10 meters above the object. I'll move slightly closer to ensure the object remains centered.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-9, 9, -19)</Action>
```

This action will position the drone directly over the object and close enough to reply with "FOUND" on the next move if the altitude is correct.
