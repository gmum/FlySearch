    The current image shows a predominantly green environment with some variability in the terrain. There appears to be an anomalous white object in the center of the grid at coordinates (0, 0). Given the objective to find an object that doesn't fit with the environment, this white object is a potential candidate. I will move closer to this object and reduce altitude to check if it is the anomaly we are looking for.
