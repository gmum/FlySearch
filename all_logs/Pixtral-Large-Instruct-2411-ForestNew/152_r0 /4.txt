  ```xml
<Reasoning>I am now directly above the suspected trash pile at an altitude of 11 meters. I will lower my altitude to ensure I am within the required range and centered over the object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -2)</Action>
```

After making this move, I will verify if the object is indeed the trash pile and confirm if the altitude conditions are met.
