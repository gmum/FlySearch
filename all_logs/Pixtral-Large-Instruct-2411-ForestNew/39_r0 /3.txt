    I am currently at 28 meters above ground level. The object is now clearly visible in the center of the field of view. I will descend further to ensure I am at the correct altitude below the object.

This should bring the UAV to an altitude of 18 meters above ground level, which is below the 10-meter threshold for the trash pile. Assuming the trash pile is within the field of view and centered, I will reply with "FOUND" in the next step.
