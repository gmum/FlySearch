 ```xml
<Reasoning>I am very close to the forest fire now and need to make a final descent to ensure I am within the 10-meter altitude requirement. I will center on the fire and descend further.</Reasoning>
<Action>(13, -13, -30)</Action>
```

If the above move meets the criteria, the response should be:

```xml
FOUND
```

Let's make the move and then confirm if the final position meets the requirements to output "FOUND".
