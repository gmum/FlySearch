    The large blue object at (-53, -27) stands out in this forested environment. It doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the natural surroundings, so it might be the anomaly we are looking for. I will move closer to inspect this object and descend to ensure the drone is below 10 meters above it, which will allow for a clear identification.
