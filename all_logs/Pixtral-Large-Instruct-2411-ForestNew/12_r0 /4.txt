    I am now at a lower altitude and closer to the potential object. I will move slightly to the right to center the object in my field of view and verify if it is a person.

<Action>(7, 0, -10)</Action>
```

I will then assess if I am directly over the object and confirm if it is the person being searched for. If it is and I am within 10 meters of it, I will respond with "FOUND".
