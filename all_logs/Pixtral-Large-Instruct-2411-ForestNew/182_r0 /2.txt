    I am very close to the object at (0, -9). I will make a final descent to ensure I am within 10 meters above the object and then confirm the find.

Since your altitude is now 26 meters and you're descending 16 meters, this will bring you to 10 meters above ground level, within the required range to identify the object. If everything looks clear and the object is centered, you can confirm the find.
