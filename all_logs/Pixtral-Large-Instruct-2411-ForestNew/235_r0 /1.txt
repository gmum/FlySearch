<Reasoning>The potential anomaly, which appeared to be a blue circular object, is now more distinct and appears to be an inflatable pool. This object certainly does not fit in with the natural forest environment. I will move directly above it to ensure itâ€™s within my field of view and descend to be at most 10 meters above it to confirm the find.</Reasoning>
