<Reasoning>I see what appears to be a trash pile at the bottom of the image. I need to move closer and lower to confirm if it is indeed the trash pile and ensure I am no more than 10 meters above it.</Reasoning>

This move should bring me closer to the object and lower my altitude to get a clearer view. If this object turns out to be the trash pile, I should be within the required parameters to confirm the find.
