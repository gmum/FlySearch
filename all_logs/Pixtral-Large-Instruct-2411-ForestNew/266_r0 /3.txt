    The anomaly is now clearly in view, and it appears to be a statue that does not belong in this natural environment. It is essential to ensure that the drone is centered on the object at an altitude below 10 meters. I will move slightly to the east and descend further to get closer to the object.

If the drone is properly centered on the object and below 10 meters after this move, I will respond with "FOUND".
