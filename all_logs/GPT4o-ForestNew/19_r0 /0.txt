<Reasoning>The grid shows a forested area with no clear signs of a building at the current altitude of 64 meters. I will descend to get a closer look at the terrain to identify any structures that might be obscured by the trees. I will move slightly towards the center of the grid to increase my chances of spotting the building.</Reasoning>
