<Reasoning>The initial position doesn't clearly show the person I'm tasked with finding. I will start the search by moving towards the center of the grid, as it may provide a better view of the surroundings and possibly spot the target. Additionally, I will decrease altitude slightly to get closer to the ground.</Reasoning>
