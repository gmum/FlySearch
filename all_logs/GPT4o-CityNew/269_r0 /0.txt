<Reasoning>The anomaly may be located on the street beneath the drone, which appears to have some irregular features, such as the area near the crosswalk. I will move to the coordinate (0, 0) and lower the drone to get a closer look, ensuring I'm below 10 meters above the object if it's found.</Reasoning>
