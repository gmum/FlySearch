<Reasoning>I have moved closer to the center of the image based on the previous instruction. Currently, the coordinates (0, 0) are in the center of my field of view, and I need to reduce my altitude to ensure I am within 10 meters of the ground. I will now move slightly southward while descending to focus on the area around (0, 0, 0), as this may contain the trash pile.</Reasoning>
