<Reasoning>I am now centered around the location (0, 0, 0), which is slightly east of the trash pile's suspected location. To ensure I am within 10 meters of the trash pile, I will move eastward while maintaining a downward trajectory to stay low and centered on the object. This will help me get closer to the possible location of the trash pile.</Reasoning>
