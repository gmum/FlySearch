<Reasoning>The object is now located at the coordinates (0, 0), where a group of people is visible. This cluster of people on the street is the potential crowd I am searching for. I need to move closer to verify if it is the correct object. Since I am currently only 51 meters above the ground, this altitude is sufficient to be within 10 meters of the target once I descend.</Reasoning>
