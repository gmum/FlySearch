<Reasoning>The object seems to be located at the coordinates (0, 0), where a group of people is visible. This cluster could potentially be the crowd we are searching for. I need to move closer to verify this. Since I am currently at 1 meter above ground, I need to ascend to avoid a collision with the ground before descending to ensure I am within the required altitude to confirm the presence of the crowd.</Reasoning>
