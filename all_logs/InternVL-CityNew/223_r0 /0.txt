<Reasoning>The coordinates (-34, 17) indicate a potential anomaly, as it is one of the few points with a negative y-value, which could indicate an object below the general ground level. Since it's centered and closer to the expected target area, I will move closer to confirm if it's the anomaly.</Reasoning>
