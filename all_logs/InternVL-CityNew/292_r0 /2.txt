<Reasoning>I am still above the object. I will move slightly west and north to better position myself closer.

<Reasoning>The object is likely located at coordinates (25, 25), as it's the only marked with a yellow vehicle. I am going to move towards this spot.

<Reasoning>The object is in the lower left corner, near coordinates (-25, 25). I need to get closer to verify it is the anomaly.
