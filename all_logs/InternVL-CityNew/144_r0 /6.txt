<Reasoning>I moved to the coordinates (-19, 0) and slightly lowered to (-19, 0, -10) to investigate the area around the object of interest. I am now closer to the object, so I should move directly to the yellow square marked as the object of interest at (19, 0) to ensure I am within the 10-meter threshold above it.</Reasoning>
