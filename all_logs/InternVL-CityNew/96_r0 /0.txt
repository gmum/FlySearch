<Reasoning>I am starting the search from the center of the grid image. The coordinates (0, 0) are in the center. I will first move slightly south to cover the southern part of the grid, as the trash pile might be located there. I'll also move down to ensure I stay within the 10-meter limit. This initial move will help me get closer to any potential object and begin the search process.</Reasoning>
