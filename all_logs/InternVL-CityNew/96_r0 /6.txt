<Reasoning>The coordinates (22, 0) are now in the center of my vision. However, I need to move further east to continue searching for the trash pile. Coordinates (0, 22) are in a more eastern area. Moving east will help cover more area and bring me closer to potential objects. I'll also move down slightly to stay within the 10-meter limit.</Reasoning>
