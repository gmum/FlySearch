<Reasoning>The coordinates (39, 39) are now in the center of my vision. However, I need to move further south and down to continue searching effectively. The coordinates (0, 29) are in a more southern area. Moving south will help cover more area and bring me closer to any potential trash pile. I'll also move down slightly to stay within the 10-meter limit.</Reasoning>
