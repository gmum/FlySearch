<Reasoning>I am starting my search near the bottom center of the image, around the coordinates (0, 0), which could potentially be a shadow cast by an object. This is a strategic starting point as shadows can indicate the presence of an anomaly. I will begin by moving downward to get a closer view to confirm if it's an object of interest.</Reasoning>
