<Reasoning>The camera has moved slightly upwards and to the west to the area around coordinate (54, 54). This area is open with less dense vehicle presence and appears more like a construction site. This could potentially be the area where the anomaly is located. I will continue to scan closely to identify any unusual objects or structures.</Reasoning>
