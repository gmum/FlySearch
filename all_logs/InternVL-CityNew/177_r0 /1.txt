From the grid points and their proximity to the potential locations of the white truck, it seems I am already in close proximity to where it might be. I need to adjust my altitude to ensure I stay below 10 meters once I find it.

<Reasoning>I'm close to the potential location of the truck, so I need to lower my altitude to stay under 10 meters and be ready to confirm the object visually.</Reasoning>
