Based on the location of the grid points in the image, the white truck is likely to be near the center of the grid, possibly around point (0, 0). The coordinates indicate potential positions of the object, and the truck could be anywhere within a small range centered around this.

<Reasoning>I need to move towards the center of the grid to get closer to the potential location of the white truck. I will head slightly north to cover more area and improve my chances of finding it.</Reasoning>
