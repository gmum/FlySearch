<Reasoning>The object of interest could potentially be the small figure of a person on the street, which is located at the coordinates (0, 0) in the center of the image. To get closer to this object, I will move towards it while maintaining a safe altitude. I need to find a point that is closer to the center and higher than the current coordinates.</Reasoning>
