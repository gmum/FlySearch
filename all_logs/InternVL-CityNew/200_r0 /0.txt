<Reasoning>The police car is most likely near the crossroads of the streets (29, 29) and (0, 29), as that area contains a yellow object that resembles a police car. I need to move closer to this area to confirm if it's the police car I'm looking for. I will first move north towards the coordinates (29, 29).</Reasoning>
