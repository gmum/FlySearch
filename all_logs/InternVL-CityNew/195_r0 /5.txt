<Reasoning>Since I am now at grid coordinates (0, 0), I can see a section of the road more clearly. Moving to (10, 0) places me closer to the yellow taxi seen in the image, which could be the trash pile. Lowering to 20 meters will help confirm this identification while staying within the search area and ensuring visibility.</Reasoning>
