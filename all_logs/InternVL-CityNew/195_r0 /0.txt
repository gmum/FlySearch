<Reasoning>The object is likely to be located in the bottom center of the image based on the given context and coordinates. The coordinates (0, 0) are centered and within the searchable area, which is logical to check first. Moving to this area will help in determining if this is the location of the large trash pile. I am lowering to 70 meters to keep within the search area and maintain visibility.</Reasoning>
