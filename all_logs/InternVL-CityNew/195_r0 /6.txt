<Reasoning>I am currently centered over the road, and moving to (0, 13) places me directly over where the trash pile appears to be located. Since the pile is already close, I need to lower to ensure I don't miss it. Reducing altitude to 10 meters will help confirm the presence of the trash pile.</Reasoning>
