<Reasoning>Since I am now at grid coordinates (0, 0), I can see the crosswalk indicating a possible location of the trash pile. Lowering the altitude closer to the ground will help confirm if this is the correct area. Moving to (0, 23) allows me to stay in the field of view and check the area around the crosswalk.</Reasoning>
