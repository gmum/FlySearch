<Reasoning>Since I am currently at grid coordinates (0, 0), I am directly over the crosswalk. I need to descend further to confirm if the trash pile is underneath me. Moving to (17, 17) while maintaining a low altitude will help me check the area closely without flying too low and potentially missing the object if it's not directly underneath.</Reasoning>
