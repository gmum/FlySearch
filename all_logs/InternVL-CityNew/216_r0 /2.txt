<Reasoning>I am now focusing on the coordinates around (0, 0), where there are yellow objects similar to those observed before. Given the proximity and similarity to the detected anomalies, this area seems likely to host the object of interest. I will move slightly upward to ensure a closer inspection without exceeding the 10-meter altitude limit.</Reasoning>
