<Reasoning>Based on the image, there are no significant differences visible compared to the previous image. The central intersection (0, 0) still shows typical urban features without any noticeable anomalies. I will move slightly north to check the area around (0, 24), as it is close to the intersection and might reveal any anomalies that aren't clear from the center point.</Reasoning>
