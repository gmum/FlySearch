<Reasoning>This is the first step in the search process. I need to start by looking closer at the area between points (54, 54) and (27, 54) as they are in the center and might contain the anomaly. I will move moderately lower to ensure a clear line of sight while maintaining a good view of the area. The target could be located near these coordinates, and moving down slightly will help narrow the search area.</Reasoning>
