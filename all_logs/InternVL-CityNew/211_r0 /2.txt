<Reasoning>I need to move towards the center of the grid to search more effectively. Since the anomaly could be near the apparent vehicles on the grid, I will fly slightly to the west to get closer to the vehicles and potentially identify the object. Moving towards the point (-10, 0) seems logical as it places me near the vehicles.</Reasoning>
