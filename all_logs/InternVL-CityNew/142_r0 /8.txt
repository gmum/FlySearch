<Reasoning>The object of interest appears to be at point (0, 4) and is relatively close to the ground. To center on it and stay within the 10-meter limit, I should slightly increase altitude and move eastward to point (4, 4, 0). This will help me maintain a safe distance and stay focused on the potential trash pile.
