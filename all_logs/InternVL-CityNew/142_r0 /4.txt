<Reasoning>I'm close to the ground, maintaining a low altitude near the object of interest, which is near the point (0, 0). To ensure I'm still close to the object without hitting the ground, I should slightly increase altitude. Moving to point (0, 0, -5) will help me maintain proximity while avoiding a collision with the ground.
