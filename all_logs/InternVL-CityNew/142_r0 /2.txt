<Reasoning>I am now 1 meter above the ground and very close to the ground, which is undesirable as per the emergency stop. I should adjust my altitude to maintain a safe distance from the ground. Moving to point (0, 0, 10) will increase altitude while staying within the search area and not moving outside the visible grid.
