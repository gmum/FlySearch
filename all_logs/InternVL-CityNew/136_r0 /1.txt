<Reasoning>I am now within a few meters above the top of the object, which is near the point (0, 0). Moving slightly west could bring the object into the center of my field of view, which will be necessary for confirming if this is the correct object and to ensure I am below 10 meters before declaring "FOUND."</Reasoning>
