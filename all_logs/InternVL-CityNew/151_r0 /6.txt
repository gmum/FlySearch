<Reasoning>I have moved towards the point (0, 4, 6), but there is still no clear indication of a trash pile. The presence of vehicles and more grid points suggests a different section of interest. I will move towards the point (0, 8, 12) to continue searching a different section of the area.</Reasoning>
