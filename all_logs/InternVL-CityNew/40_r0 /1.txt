<Reasoning>Based on the updated grid position and altitude, it seems I am now closer to the red sport car, as it is now located at coordinates (24, 48). To ensure I am within 10 meters above the car, I will slightly adjust my position to the right and descend to be directly above the car, ensuring I'm centered on it and within the required altitude range.</Reasoning>
