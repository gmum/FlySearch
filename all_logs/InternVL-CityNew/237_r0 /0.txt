<Reasoning>I need to start by analyzing the grid and identifying potential anomalies. In the image, a boat is present near the coordinates (24, 24) and (49, 24), which stand out as they are in the middle of the grid. The boat is not labeled with coordinates like the other markers, which suggests it might be the anomaly. I will move closer to these coordinates to get a better view.</Reasoning>
