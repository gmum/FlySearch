<Reasoning>I am now closer to the boat's location, which is near coordinates (24, 24) and (49, 24). The boat itself is not labeled, but it fits the description of an anomaly. I need to move slightly east to the next grid line to ensure I am directly above the boat for a closer inspection.</Reasoning>
