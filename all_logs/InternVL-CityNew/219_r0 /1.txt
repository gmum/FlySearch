<Reasoning>The coordinates (65, 65) and (33, 65) seem to indicate potential anomalies in the grid, as they are marked differently from the rest. I will move towards the area around these coordinates to investigate further.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The coordinates (0, 65) and (0, 65) show significant differences compared to surrounding coordinates, indicating they might be anomalies. I will investigate the area around these coordinates.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The coordinates (0, 65) now seem to match the surrounding pattern, suggesting it might not be an anomaly. I will continue the search towards coordinates (33, 65) and (65, 65) to ensure no anomaly is missed.</Reasoning>
