<Reasoning>The trash pile, if present, is likely located on the ground or in a low area between the buildings. I need to start by checking one of the lower grid points where the probability of finding it is higher. I will move towards (-16, 0) since it's closer to the building edges, which is a possible location for a trash pile.</Reasoning>
