<Reasoning>I have reached the coordinates (0, 0) over the water, which is where the coordinates change significantly, suggesting the presence of an object. I need to descend to get a closer view to confirm if this is the object, as it is now within my field of vision and I need to ensure I am below 10 meters for the "FOUND" report.</Reasoning>
