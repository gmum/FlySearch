<Reasoning>Based on the previous image, the object appears to be near the coordinates (0, 31) given the shadow and the structure. I need to move closer to this area to verify if it is a road construction site. Since the object might be at (0, 31), I will slightly adjust the altitude to ensure I can verify its location.</Reasoning>
