<Reasoning>I am starting at coordinates (0, 0) and need to identify the area that might contain the road construction site. The initial altitude is 94 meters. I need to determine a direction to move that might bring me closer to the potential construction site, focusing on the coordinates around (0, 31) as indicated by the large shadow in the image.</Reasoning>
