<Reasoning>The object appears to be near the coordinates (0, 25) as indicated by the shadows and structure's location. To confirm its position, I need to descend to a closer altitude and ensure I am directly above it. Given the current altitude of 74 meters, moving downward will help I confirm its location and altitude.</Reasoning>
