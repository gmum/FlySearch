<Reasoning>Based on the previous images, the object seems to be near coordinates (0, 28) as indicated by the proximity of the structure. Moving closer will help confirm its location and altitude. Given the altitude is 84 meters, I need to ensure I do not exceed 10 meters above the object once I reach it.</Reasoning>
