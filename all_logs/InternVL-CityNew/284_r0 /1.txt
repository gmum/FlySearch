<Reasoning>I am currently centered over a rooftop, which could be a likely location for the anomaly. Moving slightly to the east towards (0, 20) allows me to check this area while maintaining a general focus on the central grid. This ensures I cover a potential hiding place for the anomaly without straying far from the initial search area.</Reasoning>
