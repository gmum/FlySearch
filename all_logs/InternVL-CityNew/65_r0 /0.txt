<Reasoning>I am initially at a high altitude, and based on the grid and the given hint about the crowd being at (0, 0), I need to descend and move towards that location to narrow down the search area. I'll start by moving slightly towards (0, 0) to get closer to the ground and focus on the area where the potential crowd is located.</Reasoning>
