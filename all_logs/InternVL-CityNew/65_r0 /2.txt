<Reasoning>I have confirmed that the object is indeed at (0, 0) and not at (0, 1) or (-1, 0), as I am currently centered over the ground directly above the crowd. To ensure I am below 10 meters and centered on the object, I will slightly increase my altitude to 10 meters to complete the search and confirm the location.</Reasoning>
