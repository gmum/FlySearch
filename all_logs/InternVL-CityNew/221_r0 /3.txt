<Reasoning>I need to get closer to the coordinates of interest, specifically around (31, 31) and (15, 31), to check for any anomalies in the area. Moving slightly south to (20, 31, 0) will help me focus on this area.</Reasoning>

Your current altitude is 46 meters above ground level. 
<Reasoning>I need to move closer to the coordinates of interest at (0, 31) to ensure I am centered on the area where the anomaly might be located. This will help me investigate further.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The anomaly appears to be on the rooftop in the upper left corner, near the coordinates (15, 31). Moving slightly north and downward to (15, 31, -10) will center me directly above this area for a closer inspection.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am now centered on the rooftop area, which seems to have an object that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment
