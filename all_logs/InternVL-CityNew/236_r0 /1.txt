<Reasoning>The north direction on the grid was taken as positive y, so moving north to (0, 22, 0) will position me above a potential grid point that could be the anomaly, which is (22, 44). This will allow me to visually inspect it more closely, ensuring I can determine if it's the object of interest.</Reasoning>
