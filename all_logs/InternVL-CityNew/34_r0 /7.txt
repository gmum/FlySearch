<Reasoning>I am hovering over the intersection, which contains a crosswalk and some pedestrians, suggesting a potential construction site. The individuals near the crosswalk could be directing traffic or overseeing work. I will maintain my position to monitor these people and the surrounding area for any construction signs or equipment.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am directly above the intersection, observing individuals near the crosswalk. There are work cones and a person wearing a high-visibility vest, which are consistent with a construction site. I will hover to confirm if this is indeed the road construction site.</Reasoning>
