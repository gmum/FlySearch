<Reasoning>I am currently directly above the intersection, with a clear view of individuals near the crosswalk wearing high-visibility vests and cones. This indicates an active construction site. I will remain in this position to ensure I have a clear view of the workers and construction materials to confirm the site's presence.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am still hovering above the intersection, closely observing the construction workers and equipment. The workers near the crosswalk and the presence of cones confirm this is a construction site. I am within the specified altitude range of 10 meters for finding the object.</Reasoning>
