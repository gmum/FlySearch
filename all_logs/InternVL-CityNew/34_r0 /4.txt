<Reasoning>I am currently at a lower altitude and very close to the intersection, where road construction sites are often located. Maintaining a low altitude and remaining centered on the intersection allows me to continue inspecting the area for any construction signs or activities. Since the construction site is likely near the intersection and I am close enough to verify details, I will hover closely to confirm the site's presence.</Reasoning>
