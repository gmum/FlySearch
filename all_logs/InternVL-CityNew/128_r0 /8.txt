<Reasoning>I am currently centered near the coordinates (0, 0) and need to investigate further. The coordinates around (26, 0) and (0, 26) suggest positions of potential targets. I will move slightly north and lower my altitude to the point (26, 0, -5) to focus on these coordinates and get closer to the ground for a better view.</Reasoning>
