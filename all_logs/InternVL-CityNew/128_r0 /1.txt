<Reasoning>I need to focus on areas where the coordinates indicate potential targets, specifically around the origin (0, 0, 0). The coordinates (29, 0) and (0, 29) suggest positions of potential heat signatures. I will move towards the point (29, 0, -20) to align with the coordinates of these potential targets and move closer to the ground for a better view.</Reasoning>
