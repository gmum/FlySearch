<Reasoning>I am currently centered near the coordinates (0, 0) and need to investigate further. The coordinates around (28, 0) suggest a position of a potential target. I will move slightly south to the point (28, 0, -5) to get closer to the ground and align with this coordinate for a better view.</Reasoning>
