<Reasoning>I am currently centered over an area with coordinates (0, 0) and need to investigate further. The coordinates around (29, 0) suggest a position of a potential target. I will move slightly north and lower my altitude to focus on this coordinate and get closer to the ground for a better view.</Reasoning>
