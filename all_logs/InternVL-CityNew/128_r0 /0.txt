<Reasoning>I am currently positioned at (0, 0) and need to start the search. The object is likely on the ground level or slightly above, so moving slightly upwards may help in identifying the object. I will start by moving forward to the point (0, 0, 0) to align with the coordinates of potential targets.</Reasoning>
