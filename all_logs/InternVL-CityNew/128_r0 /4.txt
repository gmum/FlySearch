<Reasoning>I am currently centered over an area with coordinates (0, 0) and need to investigate further. The coordinates around (0, 0) are closely packed and indicate potential targets, such as (15, 0) and (0, 15). I will move slightly west and lower my altitude to focus on these coordinates and get closer to the ground for a better view.</Reasoning>
