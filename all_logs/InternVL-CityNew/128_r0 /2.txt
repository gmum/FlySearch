<Reasoning>I am currently centered near (0, 0) and need to investigate the area more closely. Moving slightly to the east and lowering my altitude will help me focus on potential targets. I will move towards the point (22, 0, -10) to get closer to the ground and align with the coordinates of the potential targets.</Reasoning>
