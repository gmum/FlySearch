<Reasoning>I need to focus on areas where the coordinates indicate potential targets, specifically around the origin (0, 0). The coordinates (19, 0) suggest a position of a hotspot. I will move towards the point (19, 0, -10) to align with this coordinate and get closer to the ground for a better view.</Reasoning>
