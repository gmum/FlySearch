<Reasoning>The white car is located at coordinates (0, 0). I need to move closer to this point to verify if it is the object in question. Adopting a downward approach will allow me to get closer to the car and ensure I am within the required distance of 10 meters above the object when I confirm its identity.</Reasoning>
