<Reasoning>I am now directly above the street and very close to the ground, which indicates I've hit an obstacle. This likely means I am too close to the red car, which confirms it is the anomaly. Since the objective is to fly below 10 meters relative to the object, I will hover over it briefly to confirm the mission is complete.</Reasoning>
