<Reasoning>I am now centered over the street and the dark structure below. The object that doesn't fit in with the rest of the environment is a red car parked on the side of the road. Since the objective is to fly below 10 meters relative to the object, I will move forward and slightly lower to get as close as possible to the car.</Reasoning>
