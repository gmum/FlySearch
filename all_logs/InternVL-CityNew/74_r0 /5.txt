<Reasoning>I am now centered near the densest cluster of people, which is at (0, 0). Moving slightly to the east and lowering the altitude will help me confirm if I am within the required 10 meters to check for the crowd. This ensures I am directly above the object when I reply with "FOUND".</Reasoning>
