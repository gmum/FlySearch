<Reasoning>As the coordinates (0, 0) did not seem to indicate an anomaly, I will move north to coordinates (32, 0) to continue the search for the anomaly. This direction will allow me to explore a different section of the grid and potentially identify the object that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment.</Reasoning>
