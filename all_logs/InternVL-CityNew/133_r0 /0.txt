<Reasoning>I am starting my search from the given coordinates. The first step is to explore the area around the initial position to identify potential locations for the trash pile. The coordinates (0, 0) seem promising as they are in the center and the grid is relatively open, suggesting a possibility of dumping areas. I will move slightly to the north to cover more ground and look for any signs of trash.</Reasoning>
