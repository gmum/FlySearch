<Reasoning>The image shows a grid with coordinates indicating potential positions of an object. The center of the grid is marked as (0, 0), but it's unclear if this is the actual object. The coordinates with a height of 0, specifically at (0, 0), might be the fire given it's at ground level and is within the starting search area. I will move closer to this location to verify if it is the object.</Reasoning>
