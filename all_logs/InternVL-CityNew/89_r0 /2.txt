<Reasoning>I need to move to the grid point marked as "(0, 0)" where the smoke is visible. This location appears to be directly above the object of interest, and I need to get closer to ensure it's the source of the fire. Moving slightly downward will help me approach the object while maintaining a low altitude.</Reasoning>
