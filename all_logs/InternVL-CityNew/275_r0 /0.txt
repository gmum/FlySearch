<Reasoning>The object is likely located in the bottom-left quadrant of the image, as indicated by the coordinate (-55, -55) which is furthest away from the center. Currently, I am too high to get a clear view, so I need to move down. I will first move to (-27, -27) which is closer to the potential location of the object.</Reasoning>
