<Reasoning>The object is likely located at the center of the image, near the coordinate (0, 0). I am at a very low altitude now, which allows me to view the area more clearly. I will move to (0, 0, 5) to slightly increase altitude and confirm if the object is at ground level or just above.</Reasoning>
