<Reasoning>I have detected a potential collision as I flew too close. To avoid any damage, I need to immediately ascend to a safer altitude and reposition myself. Currently, I am at 90 meters above ground. I will move to a position that is further away and adjust my altitude to ensure I am not too close to any obstacles.

I will adjust my position to (0, 0, 110) to ascend and reposition safely.
