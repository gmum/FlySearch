<Reasoning>The red pickup truck is located in the center of the grid, at coordinates (0, 0). My current altitude is 31 meters. To ensure I am flying below 10 meters relative to the object, I need to descend to at least 21 meters. I will move slightly north to better position myself for a closer inspection.

I will adjust my position to (0, 0, -14) to approach the object while lowering my altitude.
