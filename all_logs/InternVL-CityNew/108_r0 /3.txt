<Reasoning>The red pickup truck is now visible at coordinates (0, 22). I am currently at 66 meters above ground, which is above the object. To meet the objective of flying below 10 meters relative to the object, I need to descend to at least 56 meters. I will move slightly north to better position myself closer to the object.

I will adjust my position to (0, 22, -42) to approach the object while lowering my altitude.
