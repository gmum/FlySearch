<Reasoning>The red pickup truck is now visible at coordinates (6, 11). I am currently at 17 meters above ground, which is above the object. To meet the objective of flying below 10 meters relative to the object, I need to descend to at least 7 meters. I will move slightly south to better position myself closer to the object.

I will adjust my position to (0, 6, -15) to approach the object while lowering my altitude.
