I need to adjust my search area based on the latest coordinates. The object is now somewhat towards the east, at coordinates like (9, 9) and (18, 9).

<Reasoning>The object appears slightly to the east now, towards coordinates like (9, 9) and (18, 9). I will adjust my position accordingly to ensure I am centered on the new likely location of the object.</Reasoning>
