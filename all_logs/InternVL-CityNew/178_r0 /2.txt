<Reasoning>The white truck is now located at coordinates (11, 0), and I am currently at coordinates (11, 0) with an altitude of 33 meters. To meet the objective of flying below 10 meters, I must descend further. I will move slightly south to (10, 0) and reduce the altitude to ensure I am within the required 10 meters above the object.</Reasoning>
