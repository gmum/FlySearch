<Reasoning>The white truck is still at coordinates (11, 0), and I am at (10, 0) with an altitude of 23 meters. To ensure I am within 10 meters above the object, I need to continue descending. I will move slightly west to (9, 0) and further reduce the altitude to ensure I am within the required 10 meters above the object.</Reasoning>
