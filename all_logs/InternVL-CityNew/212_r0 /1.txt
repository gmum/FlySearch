<Reasoning>My current position is close to the street intersection, which is a common area for vehicles and potential anomalies. To confirm if there's an anomaly, I need to be directly above the intersection to ensure visibility and proximity. Moving lower will help in closely inspecting the street for any irregularities.</Reasoning>
