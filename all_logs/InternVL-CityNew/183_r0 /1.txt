<Reasoning>The white pickup truck might be located near the intersection with the crosswalk, as indicated by the presence of vehicles and the crosswalk pattern. I will move to the center of the intersection to check for the white pickup truck and will start reducing altitude to ensure I am flying below 10 meters if the object is found.</Reasoning>
