<Reasoning>The yellow point is located below the yellow point (53, 53) and closer to the center of the image. Since it's closer to the center, I will move towards it to get a better view and potentially find the crowd. The coordinates (0, 0, -20) will bring me closer to this location without exceeding the altitude limit.
