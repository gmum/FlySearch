<Reasoning>I am now positioned above the yellow object marked on the grid, which is at coordinates (0, 25). This object stands out as it is the only yellow point in the scene. To find if it is the anomaly, I will move downward while staying centered on it. 

I will move to the coordinates (0, 25, -5) to begin the close inspection.
