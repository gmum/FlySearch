<Reasoning>The yellow object is still visible at coordinates (0, 25), and I am positioned at an altitude of 64 meters. Since I need to be within 10 meters of the object to confirm it as the anomaly, I will move slightly downward to ensure I am closer to it.

I will move to the coordinates (0, 25, -10) to get closer to the yellow object.
