<Reasoning>The object appears to be situated near the intersection of the grid lines marked (0, 0) and (0, -25). I will begin my search by moving towards this area, as it seems most likely to contain the anomaly based on the grid coordinates provided.

I will start by moving to the coordinates denoted by (0, 0) while maintaining my current altitude.
