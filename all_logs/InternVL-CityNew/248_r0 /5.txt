<Reasoning>The yellow object is still visible at coordinates (0, 25) on the grid. My current altitude of 59 meters ensures I am within 10 meters of the object. I will verify further that I am indeed below 10 meters and centered on it for confirmation.

I will stay at the coordinates (0, 25, 0) to confirm my position.
