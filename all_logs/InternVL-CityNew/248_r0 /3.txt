<Reasoning>The yellow object is now centered at coordinates (0, 25) on the grid, and I am directly above it at an altitude of 69 meters. To ensure I am below 10 meters when I find the object, I need to descend further. 

I will move to the coordinates (0, 25, -10) to get closer to the yellow object.
