<Reasoning>I am now close to the yellow object at coordinates (0, 25), and I am directly above it at an altitude of 59 meters. Since I am already well below the 10-meter threshold, I will confirm if this is the anomaly and ensure I am centered and within 10 meters above it by maintaining my current altitude or slightly descending if necessary.

I will stay at the coordinates (0, 25, 0) to confirm if this is the object of interest.
