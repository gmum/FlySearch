<Reasoning>I'm now closer to the area indicated by the coordinates (0, 0) and (0, -25). The yellow object is still visible and located near (0, 25), which is still in my field of view. I need to move further towards the yellow object to ensure I am below 10 meters when I find it.

I will move to the coordinates (0, 25) to get closer to the yellow object.
