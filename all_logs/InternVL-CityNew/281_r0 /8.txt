<Reasoning>My investigation near the coordinates (-11, 6) confirmed a red vehicle, distinct from the surroundings. This anomaly aligns with the previous observations of red vehicles at similar coordinates. I will review the data to ensure there are no other potential anomalies and ensure a safe altitude before continuing the search.</Reasoning>
