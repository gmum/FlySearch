<Reasoning>The crane in the picture is still visible at the center, indicating the construction site is still in view. However, moving directly up would increase the altitude beyond the limit of 120 meters. To verify the site while remaining within altitude constraints, I will start descending slightly to keep in close proximity, centered on the crane.</Reasoning>
