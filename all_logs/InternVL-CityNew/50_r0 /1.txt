<Reasoning>I am now at a lower altitude, closer to the structure, and the fire is visible in the center of the image. The coordinates show that the fire is at (0, 0), which is directly below me. I will maintain my altitude around 64 meters and focus on scanning this area to confirm if it's the source of the fire.</Reasoning>
