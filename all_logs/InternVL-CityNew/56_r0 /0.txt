<Reasoning>I need to start moving towards a specific area to begin my search for the trash pile. The coordinates (27, 27) are likely a good place to begin since they show a higher elevation difference, suggesting there might be an object below. I will move towards this area first to assess the situation and continue my search.</Reasoning>
