<Reasoning>I need to move closer to the area near coordinates (0, 0) to get a better view of the object. Since my current altitude is already low, moving slightly south to (0, -16) will bring me closer to the central area where the object might be located. This adjustment will help me determine if the object is in this specific area and prepare for a closer inspection if needed.</Reasoning>
