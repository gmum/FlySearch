<Reasoning>I am now centered over the coordinates (0, 0), which is the likely location of the object. Moving slightly south towards coordinates (0, -11) will bring me even closer to the central area where the object might be located. This adjustment will help me verify if the object is indeed in this specific area and prepare for a closer inspection if needed.</Reasoning>
