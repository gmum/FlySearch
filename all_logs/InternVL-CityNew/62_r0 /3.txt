<Reasoning>I am now in the vicinity of the suspected object location. Moving slightly south towards coordinates (-16, 0) will bring me even closer to this area, allowing me to focus on the coordinates (0, 0) where the object might be located. This will help me to verify if the object is indeed in this area and to prepare for a closer inspection if needed.</Reasoning>
