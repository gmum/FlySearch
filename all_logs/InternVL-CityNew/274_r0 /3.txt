<Reasoning>Upon reviewing the grid, I notice that the area around the coordinates (-24, -24, -5) contains structures that do not seem to fit the pattern typical of the rest of the environment. This area is worth closer inspection to determine if it holds the anomaly. Moving towards this point allows me to examine it more carefully.</Reasoning>
