<Reasoning>I need to start by examining the lower part of the grid to identify any anomalies, as the object might be closer to the ground or situated in that area. I will move down and to the north to check the coordinates (0, 33, -10). This area could potentially contain the anomaly, especially since the object is expected to be located in this section of the grid.</Reasoning>
