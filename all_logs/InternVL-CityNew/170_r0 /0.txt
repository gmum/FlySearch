<Reasoning>The object appears to be located in the center of the image, roughly at coordinates (0, 0) given the grid overlay. Starting from my current altitude of 55 meters, I will move towards the center to get closer and confirm if it's the object. This move will help me get a better view and check if I need to descend further.</Reasoning>
