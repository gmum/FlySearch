<Reasoning>I moved closer to the center of the image, which is at coordinates (0, 0), to get a better view of the object. Given that I am now at 45 meters, I should continue moving slightly south to see if the object is in the southern area. This will help me narrow down the search area and confirm if the object is there.</Reasoning>
