 <Reasoning>I need to get the object, which is likely at (0, 0), into my field of view. The distance to the object is approximately 13 meters. To be 10 meters below the object, I need to descend 3 meters. However, to stay within the view limitations and comply with the altitude restrictions, I will make this altitude change.</Reasoning>
