 <Reasoning>The object I'm searching for appears to be at (0, 0), which is about 17 meters distant. To get the object into my field of view, I must descend 17 meters. Since I'm supposed to be 10 meters below the object, I will further decrease my altitude by 7 meters below the estimated distance to the object.</Reasoning>
