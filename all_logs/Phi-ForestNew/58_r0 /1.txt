    The coordinates in the image range from (-5, -2) to (5, 5) which suggests a smaller area compared to the first image. The vegetation appears denser in the central part of the image, particularly around coordinates (0, -2) and (0, -5). These areas seem promising for finding a campsite due to the likely presence of trees or bushes offering protection and resources.
