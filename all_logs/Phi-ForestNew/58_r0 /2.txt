 <Reasoning>
    The coordinates in the image range from (-1, 1) to (1, 1) which is a much smaller area with less apparent vegetation. The central part of the image has a mix of green and brown, indicating some trees but also areas of cleared land or rocks. Since we are looking for a campsite, areas with more visible trees would be ideal, but considering the supposed emergency, there are few options left.
