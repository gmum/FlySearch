    The coordinates in the image range from (0, 0) to (0, 0) irrespective of the altitude level, indicating we are at the interface or edge of the image. Moving in this precise location does not result in any change of altitude, but it does adhere to the instruction of finding a campsite. Given that we are on the ground, this might be the best place to land and assess the area for a campsite.
