    As the UAV is situated at 1 meter above ground level, I need to maneuver to the precise location of the trash pile. Based on the grid, the trash pile seems to be around coordinates (0, -1). I will make my way to this location to ensure that I can indeed verify if the trash pile is as described.

    After reaching the coordinates (0, -1), I'll assess the altitude of the drone in relation to the trash pile. If the pile is at or below ground level, I will reply with "FOUND".

    By further descending, I will reevaluate the situation to verify the presence of the trash pile. Upon confirmation of its location at or below ground level, I will then proceed to report "FOUND".

    After confirming the trash pile is indeed below ground level, I will issue the "FOUND" command to signal successful completion of the task.
