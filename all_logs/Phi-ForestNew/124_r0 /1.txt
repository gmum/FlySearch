    With the UAV starting at an altitude of 31 meters above ground level, I must descend to approach the suspected trash pile which might be at or below ground level. I'll analyze the grid to find the trash pile's approximate location. It seems to be around coordinates (-21, -10). I will then move the drone to these coordinates to investigate whether the trash pile is indeed there.

    After descending to the coordinates (-21, -2), I will check the altitude of the drone relative to the trash pile. If the pile is at or below the ground level, I will reply with "FOUND".

    After descending further, I will determine the presence of the trash pile. If it is below ground level, I will confirm this by reporting "FOUND".
