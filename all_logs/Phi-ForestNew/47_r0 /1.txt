 <Reasoning>The image displays a grid with coordinates overlaid, indicating the area to be searched for the trash pile. Since I'm at an altitude of 28 meters, I must lower my altitude to a point that's below my current altitude, increasing the likelihood of spotting the trash pile on the ground.</Reasoning>

<Action>(-3, -19, -15)</Action>

<Reasoning>I'll move to (-3, -19) to gain a better view closer to the ground, which is essential for locating the trash pile. If the object is not visible, I will proceed to the next closest point below my altitude while also considering the visibility of the object.</Reasoning>

<Action>(-3, -19, -20)</Action>

<Reasoning>From (-3, -19), I will scan for the trash pile, ensuring to be in the correct elevation to spot it. If not found, I will adjust my position to the next closest point below my altitude, while still keeping the object within my field of view.</Reasoning>
