 <Reasoning>The image shows an entire grid with various points indicating potential areas of the trash pile. At an altitude of 12 meters above ground level, it is necessary for me to fly down to a point that's below this altitude for a better chance of spotting the trash pile on the ground.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Upon reviewing the map, I've identified that (-5, -12) is a suitable location to lower my altitude and enhance my view of the ground where the trash pile could be. If the object isn't visible from this position, I'll continue searching while ensuring that all search areas are within my field of view.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>With the drone now positioned at (-5, -12, -15), I'll thoroughly scan the area for the trash pile. Once it is confirmed to be in my view, I'll make sure to be at or below 10 meters altitude to verify its presence and provide the correct response.</Reasoning>
