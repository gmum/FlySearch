 <Reasoning>The image shows a grid with various points plotted, which could represent areas of interest, including potential locations of the trash pile. Given that the current altitude is 44 meters above ground level, I need to decrease altitude to get a closer view of the area on the ground below. To do this, I must choose a point below my current altitude which would also be in the field of view when I declare "FOUND".</Reasoning>

<Action>(28, -9, -15)</Action>

<Reasoning>I have decided to move to the point (-28, -15, 0) based on the grid, as it is below my current altitude and should allow me to have a closer view on the ground, which increases the chance of finding the trash pile.</Reasoning>

<Action>(-28, -15, -20)</Action>

<Reasoning>From this point, I will look for the trash pile and if found, I will proceed to fly below 10 meters to it to ensure it is within my field of view. If the object is not found, I will continue to search based on the next closest point that is below my altitude.</Reasoning>
