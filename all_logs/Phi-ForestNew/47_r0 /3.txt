 <Reasoning>The image presents a grid with coordinates overlaid, aiding in identifying the potential location of the trash pile. At an altitude of 1 meter, it is imperative to lower the drone to a point that allows for a thorough search of the area on the ground.</Reasoning>

<Action>(-3, 0, -1)</Action>

<Reasoning>Upon assessment, the point (-3, 0, -1) is a strategic location for the drone to transition to, to improve the likelihood of finding the trash pile as it's both below my current altitude and within a clear view of the ground.</Reasoning>

<Action>(-3, 0, -2)</Action>

<Reasoning>Moving to (-3, 0, -2), I will concentrate on this area for a detailed look. If the trash pile is not within my view, I will adjust my drone's position to the nearest point within my altitude range that allows for continued search while ensuring all moves remain within my limited flight area at or below 10 meters altitude.</Reasoning>
