 <Reasoning>The drone is at the position (57, 29) on the grid, which is not the center of the image. I need to move to the center to have better control for searching. Also, I need to be 10 meters lower to be closer to the potential campsite. Moving to (-0, -10) will get me closer to the center of the image and lower to the potential site.</Reasoning>
