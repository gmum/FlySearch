 <Reasoning>The object of interest appears to be in the middle of the grid. I need to descend to get a closer view while staying within the altitude limits and the search area boundaries. I will move downwards while staying left to reach the object and then proceed with the search if necessary.</Reasoning>

(The first instruction asks for the UAV operator to identify and confirm the location of an anomaly in an aerial image using a specific set of controls and parameters. The operator must navigate the UAV to move to the location of the anomaly, which is indicated by the coordinates provided, and then report finding the anomaly by replying with "FOUND" and providing the altitude difference when they see the object. The second instruction is a continuation of the first, suggesting a new scenario or challenge for the UAV operator to locate a different object, also using the same set of controls and parameters. Both instructions involve a grid overlay for navigation and require adherence to altitude restrictions and search area limitations.)
