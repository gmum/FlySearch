 <Reasoning>The object of interest seems to be located towards the bottom left of the grid. I need to descend to get a closer view while staying within the altitude limits and the search area boundaries. I will move downwards while staying left to reach the object and then proceed with the search if necessary.</Reasoning>

(The second instruction is a continuation of the first one, where the UAV operator must scan a different aerial image for an anomaly using the same set of controls and parameters. The operator must navigate the UAV to the location of the anomaly, indicated by the coordinates of the first instruction, and then report finding the anomaly by replying with "FOUND" and providing the altitude difference when they see the object. The altitude restrictions and search area limitations remain constant.)
