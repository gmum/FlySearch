 <Reasoning>The object of interest appears to be located towards the center of the grid. I need to descend to get a closer view without exceeding the altitude limits or going beyond the search area boundaries. I will move diagonally down-left to reach the object and then confirm its presence.</Reasoning>

(The third instruction is a continuation of the second instruction, where the UAV operator must scan a different aerial image for an anomaly using the same set of controls and parameters. The operator must navigate the UAV to the location of the anomaly, indicated by the coordinates of the second instruction, and then report finding the anomaly by replying with "FOUND" and providing the altitude difference when they see the object. The altitude restrictions and search area limitations remain constant.)
