    I am looking for a trash pile in the image. The yellow point could be the trash pile, so I will head towards it and hover below it at a lower altitude.

    I will continue to hover below the yellow point. This will allow me to check closely if it is the trash pile I am looking for.

    I need to check if there are other potential trash piles. I will move slightly north and go up to confirm if the trash pile is not in the heart of the yellow area.

    I will move down and check the area around the yellow point. I need to be sure it is a trash pile before
