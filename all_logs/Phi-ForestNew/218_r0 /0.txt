 <Reasoning>The image indicates a grid with points scattered across, suggesting a field of varying terrain and vegetation. I will initiate a search pattern by descending towards areas with potential to contain the anomaly, focusing on regions with less dense vegetation where objects may stand out more. I will also adjust my altitude to be as low as possible within the 10-meter limit to facilitate a closer inspection.</Reasoning>
