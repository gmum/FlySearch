 <Reasoning>At this critical altitude, the drone's search for the anomaly becomes a race against time. The drone will execute the most direct and efficient route to the center of the grid, (0, 0), and use its sensors to scan for any signs of the anomaly. If the anomaly is not found at the origin, the drone will expand its search outward, while continuously adjusting its altitude to remain within the safe and effective range for inspection.</Reasoning>
