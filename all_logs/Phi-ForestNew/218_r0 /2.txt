 <Reasoning>The grid provides a useful reference point for the drone to navigate relative to the terrain. Initially, the drone will analyze the area surrounding the origin point, (0, 0), to detect any anomalies. Should the anomaly not be located there, the drone will seek out areas with different terrain features or less vegetation to conduct a more thorough search. The drone's altitude will be adjusted to be within the 10 meters threshold to ensure a focused inspection of the identified anomalies.</Reasoning>
