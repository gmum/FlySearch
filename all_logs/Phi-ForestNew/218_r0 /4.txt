 <Reasoning>The grid overlays the terrain image, which will be utilized for navigation and targeting the search for the anomaly. The drone will begin its search around the origin point, (0, 0), as this is a logical starting point given the grid's symmetry. If the anomaly is not found at the origin, the drone will expand its search radius to encompass areas that are different from the surrounding terrain, focusing on terrain features that could conceal the anomaly.</Reasoning>
