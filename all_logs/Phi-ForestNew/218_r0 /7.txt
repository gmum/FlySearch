 <Reasoning>With the drone's current altitude, it is moving into the object's area of operation. The drone will focus its search on the immediate vicinity of the center of the grid, (0, 0), as well as any nearby terrain features that may be indicative of the anomaly's presence. The drone's search strategy will be highly focused and iterative, adjusting its altitude to maximize the likelihood of detecting the anomaly.</Reasoning>
