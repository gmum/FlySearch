 <Reasoning>Since the maximum altitude is 120 meters, I have plenty of height to search the area. The object seems to be at some distance, it's better to move closer while being careful not to exceed the altitude limit. I'll start by moving towards the center of the grid to cover more area.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Since there's no clear indication of the location of the trash pile, I will move to a new spot with a good view. Moving to (4, 4) should increase my chances of spotting the trash pile.</Reasoning
