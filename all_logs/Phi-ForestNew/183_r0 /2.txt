 <Reasoning>The trash pile is likely at the coordinates (0, 0), as this point is centrally located within the main anomaly concentration. Given that the image is uniformly spaced in a grid and assuming that the altitude scale is linear and consistent, the trash pile should be approximately 1 meter below the starting point. To be within the performance requirements, I should fly to the coordinates (0, 0, -1) to ensure I am 10 meters or less below the object. I will adjust my heading slightly to the right to maximize my chances of spotting the object from a different angle.</Reasoning>
