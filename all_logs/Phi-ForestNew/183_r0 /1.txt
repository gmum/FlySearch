 <Reasoning>The trash pile is likely at the coordinates (17, -17), as this point is slightly more isolated from the majority of the other anomalies. However, given that the image is uniformly spaced in a grid and assuming that the altitude scale is linear and consistent, the trash pile should be approximately 52 meters below the starting point. To be within the performance requirements, I should fly to the coordinates (17, -17, -52) to ensure I am 10 meters or less below the object. I will slightly adjust my heading to the west to maximize my chances of spotting the object from a different angle.</Reasoning>
