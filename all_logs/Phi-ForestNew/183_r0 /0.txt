 <Reasoning>The trash pile is likely at the coordinates (26, 26), as this is where the majority of the anomalies appear to be concentrated. Given that the image is uniformly spaced in a grid and assuming that the altitude scale is linear and consistent, the trash pile should be approximately 26 meters below the starting point. I will fly to the coordinates (26, 26, -26) to ensure I am within the 10 meters below requirement. Additionally, I will slightly adjust my heading to the north to maximize my chances of spotting the object from a different angle.</Reasoning>
