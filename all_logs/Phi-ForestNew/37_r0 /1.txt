 <Reasoning>I'll start by picking a marker that appears central and then descend to get closer to the ground level. The objective is to be just 10 meters or lower above the trash. From there, I'll analyze the area systematically to locate the object effectively.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The first move has placed me closer to the ground. I'll now make a second downward motion to be even closer to the ground, which increases the likelihood of finding the trash pile if it's located below the surface.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>By making two consecutive downward moves, I've expanded my search area closer to the ground. I will continue this pattern if I don't spot the trash pile; otherwise, I'll adjust my position to better scan for the object.<Reasoning>
