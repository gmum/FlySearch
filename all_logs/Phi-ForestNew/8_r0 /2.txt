<Reasoning>Upon analyzing the image, there's a significant area with less vegetation and more brown coloration that could be the search area. To better assess this area, lowering my altitude is critical. The target appears to be at the coordinate (0,0), so I need to move closer to the ground. This should allow for a more detailed inspection of the area from the ground level, thereby increasing my chances of spotting the person below the drone's current position. I will proceed with the altitude reduction to ensure the object is within my field of view when I declare it "FOUND".</Reasoning>
