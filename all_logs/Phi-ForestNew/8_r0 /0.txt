<Reasoning>The object that I'm searching for appears to be located near the center of the grid at approximately (15,15) coordinates. It seems the person might be walking, which indicates that I should lower my altitude to get a closer view. I will adjust my altitude to be closer to the ground, but must ensure that I am 10 meters or below in altitude, as any higher position could be too far from the ground to provide a closer look.</Reasoning>
