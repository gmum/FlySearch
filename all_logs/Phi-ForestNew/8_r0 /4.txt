<Reasoning>The map shows a large green area that could indicate the presence of vegetation. There might be a person, but could be slightly hidden due to the vegetation. I need to get lower to spot any movement. The person's coordinates seem to be around (0,0), which means I should focus my search in that direction. I will try to get as low as I can without losing control of the drone. Once I am confident that the person is in my field of view, I will respond with "FOUND".</Reasoning>
