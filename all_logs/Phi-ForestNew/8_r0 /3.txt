<Reasoning>After reviewing the image, it seems like the person could be located in the area directly below the drone, which is approximately (0,0). Lowering my altitude will help me to get a closer view and confirm if the person is present in that spot. The altitude should be reduced to at most 10 meters below the ground to ensure a proper view is maintained when I declare "FOUND".</Reasoning>
