<Reasoning>I'm moving the drone slightly to the right and down to (0, -1, -1), which is just below the coordinates (0, 0, -1). This movement keeps the drone within the view and at a safe distance from the terrain. The drone is now in a position where it can continue the search for the anomaly while remaining safe.</Reasoning>
