 <Reasoning>Considering the current altitude, I should focus on the areas that are within the 10-meter range from any potential target location. I will move one grid point down the way to the lower left, as it allows me to start my search closer to ground level.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Now, I need to ensure that I am moving towards an area that may have the person. The area around (25, 51) seems to be a good starting point, as it's relatively higher than the average and close to the center, which might make it easier to spot someone.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>With the drone now closer to ground level, I will scan the area around (25, 51) for any signs of the person. Since I am only 10 meters away from the ground, I have a better chance of spotting someone if they are around this point.</Reasoning
