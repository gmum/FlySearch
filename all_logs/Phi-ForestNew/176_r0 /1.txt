<Reasoning>Now I am at a height that allows me to scan the area more effectively. The person seems to be in a thick green area. I will move towards them to get a better view. As I move, I will analyze the environment for any sign of the person.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The person is not located at the (14, 14) coordinate. I need to move in a direction that brings me closer to the person. The person seems to be in a region with a mix of grassy and tree-covered areas. I will adjust my altitude and horizontal position to be closer.</Reasoning>
