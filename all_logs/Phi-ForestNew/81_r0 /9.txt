<Reasoning>

    Descending to -1 meter in altitude increases the risk of colliding with the ground and vegetation.

</Action>


<Reasoning>

    Moving to an even lower altitude of -2 meters is being excessively cautious and could result in the drone being too close to the obstacles, veering off course, or landing in vegetation.
