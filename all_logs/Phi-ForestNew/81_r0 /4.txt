 The drone can decrease its altitude to get closer to the building that is situated at the center of the image.

    Descending a meter to -3 meters in altitude will grant the drone a better view, but exceeding this altitude limit is not allowed.

    Going lower to -10 meters is NOT ADVISABLE as it is the limit, and the drone should not exceed this altitude.
