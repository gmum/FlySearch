 <Reasoning>
    I should first move towards the area with a higher altitude but close to the coordinates given. If the trash pile is not there, I will then suggest moving in a direction that could lead me to another area where the trash pile might be. This way, I can cover a wider area and increase my chances of finding the trash pile.
