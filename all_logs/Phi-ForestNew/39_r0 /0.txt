 <Reasoning>
    I initially need to take a look at the area where the yellow point is located and move in a direction that could possibly lead me to the trash pile. However, I must be careful not to go too far or too high, so as to avoid hitting any objects that could be out of view. If the yellow point is not the trash pile, I will then suggest moving in a different direction to continue the search.
