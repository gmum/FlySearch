 <Reasoning>I will fly to the grid point (26, 0) which is the closest point to the trash pile as it seems to be a point of interest on the grid. The altitude at this point would be 79 - 5 = 74 meters, which is below my current altitude and closer to the ground. I need to verify if this point is the trash pile because it is close to the bottom of the image and might be more visible.</Reasoning>
