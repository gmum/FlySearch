 <Reasoning>The image is still too high for me to see the anomaly clearly. To lower my altitude and increase my visibility, I will move closer to the object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, -5, -10)</Action>
<Reasoning>I am now flying 25 meters above the ground and 5 meters north, which should increase my chances of finding the anomaly in the image.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-5, 0, -5)</Action>
<Reasoning>The object might be closer to the coordinates (0, 0) now, and I am still maintaining a lower altitude of 20 meters, which is good for me to remain visible and safe.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-10, 0, -5)</Action>
<Reasoning>By moving further south, I am decreasing my altitude to 10 meters relative to the ground. This should bring the object into better view for identification.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-10, 0, 0)</Action>
<Reasoning>I am now flying at the coordinates (0, 0), 10 meters below the ground, which seems to be the object of interest in the image. I am in a better position to determine its nature.</Reasoning>
