    Given that the altitude has been reduced to 76 meters, I can now assess whether the object at the coordinates (0, 51) is in view. I'll make a move to reduce my altitude further to ensure it's within my field of view.

    I've moved down to (1, 0, -20), which should provide me with a clearer view of the grid and potentially give me a closer look at the coordinates (0, 51). If the object is not there, I'll continue moving to the next closest coordinates to determine if it's the anomaly.

    I cannot see the object at (0, 51) from this vantage point, so I'll move one unit right and one unit down to get a closer look at the grid point (1, 0, 0) and see if it's the object in question.
