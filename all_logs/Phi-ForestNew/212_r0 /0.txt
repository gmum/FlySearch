    The image seems to show a grid with coordinates. There's a point with coordinates (0, 58), which means it's a long way from the rest of the points. I'll start by heading there, checking to see if it's the object I'm looking for.

    I cannot directly see the object based on the coordinates provided. Given that this point (0, 58, 58) is in the top center of the image, moving in the direction of (1, 0, -10) seems like a plausible first step to get closer. I'm presuming the object may be in the vicinity, as it's the only point with a negative y-coordinate, which could suggest an elevated position compared to the rest.

    Unfortunately, I still cannot see the object at (0, 58, 58) from this vantage point. Since I can't see the object, I'll have to move to the next possible location. (1, 0, -10
