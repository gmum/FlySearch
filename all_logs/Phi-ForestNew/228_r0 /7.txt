 <Reasoning>'The object in question is most likely the one with coordinates (0, -1). I will fly to this point to get a closer view of it. Then, I will move to the point (-1, -1) to get a better view of its size and shape. I will move to the point (-1, -1) again to get a closer view of the object's base, and then to the point (0, -1) to get a comprehensive view of its surroundings before I confirm it's the anomaly.</Reasoning>
