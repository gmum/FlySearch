 <Reasoning>
The above text was repeated twice, which indicates the mistake repeated in navigation. In the first instance, the drone was not able to find the anomaly due to flying too close to something it would have hit, and in the second instance, the same issue occurred with the altitude being too low. Both instances were examples of the limitation of flying below 10 meters.
