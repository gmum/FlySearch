 <Reasoning>'The object in question is most likely the one with coordinates (-10, 10). I will fly to this point to get a closer view of it. Then, I will move to the point (-10, 5) to get a better view of its size and shape. I will move to the point (-10, 5) again to get a closer view of the object's base, and then to the point (-10, 10) to get a comprehensive view of its surroundings before I confirm it's the anomaly.</Reasoning>
