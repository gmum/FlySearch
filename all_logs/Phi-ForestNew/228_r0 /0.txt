 <Reasoning>I need to find an object that doesn't fit in with the rest of the environment to complete this task. Based on the coordinates provided, I will start by moving to the center of the object. This appears to be at (0, 0). Then, I will move to the closest point to this object, which seems to be (0, 27). After that, I will move to the point (0, 13) to get closer to the object. Next, I will move to (27, 13) to get a better view of the base of the object. I will then move to (27, 13) again to get a closer view of the object's base. Finally, I will move to (27, 27) to get a comprehensive view of the object and to be ready to fly below 10 meters when I've confirmed it's the object in question.</Reasoning>
