 <Reasoning>'The object in question is most likely the one with coordinates (-7, -7). I will fly to this point to get a closer view of it. Then, I will move to the point (-7, -6) to get a better view of its size and shape. I will move to the point (-7, -6) again to get a closer view of the object's base, and then to the point (-7, -7) to get a comprehensive view of its surroundings before I confirm it's the anomaly.</Reasoning>
