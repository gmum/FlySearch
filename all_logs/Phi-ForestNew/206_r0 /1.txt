I am currently at 29 meters, which is not the correct altitude for finding the object. I need to decrease my altitude to 10 meters to conduct a detailed search. I will make a move that reduces my altitude and targets a location that is likely to have the object based on the grid coordinates.

I am now at 10 meters below the altitude I previously started at. I will now scan the area to locate the object. Based on the coordinates on the grid, the area might have the anomaly. I will now begin my search to verify if it is the object.
