It appears that I am still at a height of 46 meters, which is too high for a detailed search of the object. I need to decrease my altitude to at least 10 meters to get close to the object in order to verify if it is the anomaly. Considering the coordinates of the area where I need to search, I will aim for a point that is likely to be 10 meters below my current altitude.
