Based on the initial coordinates, I'll aim at the center of the map, which is at (0,0). The anomaly isn't immediately visible, so I'll scan the area progressively, focusing on the coordinates where the difference between x and y is minimal.

The central point at (0,0) coordinates seems to be the anomaly. I'll calculate the move to get 10 meters below it to ensure I'm within the task guidelines.
