To begin the search for the anomaly, I would identify the central point in the image, which appears to be at (0,0) coordinates, to get a good overview of the area. The object of interest may not be immediately visible from this vantage point, so I would analyze the surrounding areas for any unusual patterns or items that differ from the rest of the environment. If a suspicious object is spotted, I will then calculate the move required to get below it, ensuring the altitude is not more than 51 meters (my current altitude) to minimize the risk.

After analyzing the area around the central point, I noticed a dark object consistent with the anomaly. I will now proceed to get low to the object, ensuring I am within 10 meters below it to fulfill the task's requirements.
