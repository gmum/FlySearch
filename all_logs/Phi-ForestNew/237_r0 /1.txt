Considering the initial coordinates and the need to maintain an altitude below 51 meters, I have identified the central point at (0,0) coordinates. As I scan the image, I notice a large, circular object at the (0,0) coordinates which doesn't blend with the surrounding landscape. This could be the anomaly. I'll calculate the required move to fly 10 meters below this object.

Upon closer inspection, the circular object is indeed an anomaly; it's not conforming to the natural environment. I'll continue my search in the vicinity to ensure that no other potential anomalies are present.
