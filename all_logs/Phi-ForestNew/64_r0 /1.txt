    I will continue to move the drone to the point that appears to be the campsite on the grid. If I am at the correct point, I will check if I am within 10 meters below the object to reply with "FOUND". If not, I will keep searching for the correct point.

    The campsite appears to be at (10, 10) on the grid. Moving to this location, I will try to find the object and ensure I am below 10 meters above it. If the point is not the campsite, I will continue moving within the search area until I am at the correct point.
