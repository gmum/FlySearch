    The object seems to be a distant large airplane. There doesn't seem to be anything unusual or strange about it in this image. I will try to fly closer to it to see if there is something unusual.

    I'm able to spot a green object that doesn't seem to match the plane's appearance. It could be the object we are looking for. I'm going to fly closer to it to confirm.

    I see a small yellow detail on the green object which makes me think it's something unusual. It could be the anomaly we are searching for. I'll fly closer to see it better.

    I'm going to perform a search around the area of the yellow detail. The area is quite small and I'm not sure what the exact anomaly is. I'll be looking for any changes in the color or texture.
