        "\n<Context>\n    You are in command of a UAV, tasked with finding a person.\n</Context>\n\n<Objective>\n    You should fly BELOW 10 meters above the object and then reply with \"FOUND\". Being lower (closer to the object) (like 9, 8, or less meters) is good, being higher than that (like 11, 12, or more meters) is bad. \n\n    You may not be able to see the object in the first image, so you need to perform a careful search. Your performance will be evaluated based on whether the object was at most 10 meters below the drone when you replied with \"FOUND\". The object MUST be in your field of view when you reply with \"FOUND\". You must be centered on the object. \n</Objective>\n\n<Coordinates>\n    There is a grid overlaid on each image you are presented with. It is meant to (roughly) communicate which point will be in drone's center of vision if you move in that direction. Note that height of the drone is not represented in the grid.\n</Coordinates>\n\n<Controls>\n    <Action space>\n        To move the drone in a certain direction, use the following format: <Action>(x, y, z)</Action>. For example, if you want to fly to the place denoted as (10, 10) on the grid without changing the altitude, you should reply with <Action>(10, 10, 0)</Action>.\n\n        x and y are the coordinates on the grid, and z is the altitude difference. For example, <Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action> means that you are moving 10 meters down. This is especially important, since you need to get close to the object in question.\n\n    </Action space>\n\n    <Formatting>\n\n        Your each response should contain XML <Reasoning> tag and <Action> tag.\n        <Reasoning> tag should contain your reasoning for the move you are making.\n        <Action> tag should contain the move you are making.\n\n        If you find the object, fly below 10 meters relative to it and reply with \"FOUND\". Remember, it must be in your field of view when you reply with \"FOUND\" and you must be 10 meters above it or closer. Being too far away is not acceptable.\n\n        For example:\n\n        <Reasoning>This yellow point might be the object in question. I need to go lower to check for that. If it's not the object in question, I will continue the search. I will also slightly go to the north.</Reasoning>\n        <Action>(5, 0, -30)</Action>\n\n    </Formatting>\n\n    <Limitations>\n        You shouldn't move into coordinates that are outside of your view. Otherwise, you may hit something which is not ideal.\n        You can make at most 9 moves. Your altitude cannot exceed 120 meters. Your search area is 400x400m from the drone's starting position. \n    </Limitations>\n</Controls>\n"

        " <Reasoning>The object of interest is indicated by the grid point (0, 0). It appears to be surrounded by trees and is centrally located in the image. Given the altitude and the surrounding terrain, it might be challenging to spot the person directly. The coordinates of the drone are (0, 0, 60), which means it is 60 meters above ground level. Since the search area is 400x400m, and my current altitude is above the lowest point of the search area, I need to descend to ensure the object is within my field of view. Therefore, I will move towards the object and lower my altitude.</Reasoning>\n<Action>(0, 0, 50)</Action>\n\n<Reasoning>Moving up to the coordinates (5, 0, 50) will increase the altitude but not reduce the search area's constraints. I am trying to reach the object that is surrounded by trees. But since the higher altitude doesn't offer a considerable decrease in altitude, it will not likely enhance the visibility of the person and may still be above the object.</Reasoning>\n<Action>(5, 0, 65)</Action>\n\n<Reasoning>My last move will be lowering further to the object.

        " <Reasoning>Considering the object's location at roughly (-0.73, 1.73), the drone needs to descend to improve visibility. The current altitude is 109 meters, which is above the object. To properly locate the person, the altitude must be reduced while ensuring the object is within view. A careful descent is essential to prevent missing the target while maintaining a safe altitude throughout the operation.</Reasoning>\n<Action>(0, 1.73, 99)</Action>\n\n<Reasoning>Since the altitude is still quite high, descending further appears necessary. This move should bring the drone closer to the object, ensuring that it is within the drone's field of view and is at the correct altitude to spot the person.</Reasoning>\n<Action>(0.2, 2.73, 92)</Action>\n\n<Reasoning>The drone's current coordinates are still not optimal for spotting the object. A further descent of 2 meters will bring the altitude closer to the object on the grid. This approach is to ensure that the object is within the drone's field of view and at a height that is conducive to spotting the person.</Reasoning>\n<Action>(2.2, 2.73, "
