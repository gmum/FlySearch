 <Reasoning>I'm continuing my Search for the trash pile and moving to the coordinates (-32, 0) to look for any distinguishable features or colors that could signify the presence of a trash pile.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Since the object is likely on the ground, I will move to the coordinates (-16, 0) and get a closer look for any distinguishable features.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The object of interest is not immediately visible, but I can see that the area around (31, -1) might be shaded differently from the surrounding area. I will move closer to confirm if it's indeed a trash pile or if it's just a regular patch.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The coloration around (31, -1) is similar to what I found around (31, 0), indicating it could potentially be a trash pile. I will move to (1, -1) to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
