        According to the coordinates on the grid, the anomaly I am looking for is located at the coordinates (0, -35), which is significantly lower than the rest. This is evident because the majority of the points are labeled with positive x and y values, and this one is labeled (0, -35), indicating it is 35 meters below the reference level.
