The object of interest might be around the coordinates (53, 53). I need to fly in that direction and then go slightly higher to ensure I'm directly above the object.

From the previous move, I am very close to the object but not yet directly underneath it. I will slightly shift my position to the north to maintain a good altitude relative to the object.

I am now directly underneath the object. I confirm it's the anomaly we were looking for. I will now move to a lower altitude.

After confirming its presence, I will now lower myself to ensure I am directly above the object to react to any potential hazards or to maintain a steady course.
