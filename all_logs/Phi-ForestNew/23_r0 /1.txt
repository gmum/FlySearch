 <Reasoning>Since the previous image does not clearly show any trash pile, I will start at the center of the grid where the terrain appears to be the flattest. This should give me the best chance to spot it given my current altitude. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I've spotted a small mound that looks like a trash pile. However, it's not very clear from this distance. I need to descend to get a better view and confirm it's what we're looking for. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The object in question is now clearly visible. It is a small mound with a dirt and greenery pattern typical of a trash pile. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I'm closer now, and it's definitely a trash pile. Given the surrounding vegetation, it's safe to assume it's a dumping ground or an area where waste is discarded. </Reasoning>
