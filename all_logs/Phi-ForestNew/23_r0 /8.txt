<Reasoning>There's a large brown patch that could be the trash pile. It's not discernible from this altitude. I'll move to the nearest grid point to the bottom right where the mound is more visible. </Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The mound at this grid point is definitely a trash pile. It's a large, brown, mound-shaped pile surrounded by vegetation, confirming it as the site we're looking for. </Reasoning>
