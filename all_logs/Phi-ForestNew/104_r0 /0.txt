 <Reasoning>I have identified a point of interest on the grid that I want to investigate further. It appears to be in a location that may be the trash pile, and it is at a lower altitude than the current altitude. To investigate further, I need to move down to 0 meters above the object.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The object is clearly visible below me, and it appears to be a trash pile. I will now fly below 10 meters relative to it to confirm my finding.</Reasoning>
