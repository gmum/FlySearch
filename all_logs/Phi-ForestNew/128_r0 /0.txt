 Given the current altitude and the object that seems to be a person located towards the bottom middle of the image, my first move would be to descend to an altitude closer to the ground to get a clear view.

<Reasoning>The person I need to find is towards the bottom of the image, and since I am currently at 62 meters above the ground, I will need to move closer to the object to ensure it is visible and distinguishable.</Reasoning>
