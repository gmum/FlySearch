 Given the coordinates of the object, my next move would be to descend and move towards the object to confirm that it is the person I am looking for.

<Reasoning>Since the object I am looking for is located at the coordinates (0, 0) and I am at 47 meters above the ground, I will need to move closer to it to ensure it is visible and distinguishable as the person I am tasked to find.</Reasoning>
