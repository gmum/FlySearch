 Given the coordinates of the object and my current altitude, my next move would be to descend and move towards the object to confirm it is the person I am looking for.

<Reasoning>The object I am looking for is located at the coordinates (-29, -15) and I am at 44 meters above the ground, so I will need to move closer to it to ensure it is visible and distinguishable as the person I am tasked to find.</Reasoning>
