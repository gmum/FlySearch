 Given the coordinates and the object towards the bottom left of the image, I would need to move closer to confirm it is the person I am looking for.

<Reasoning>The object I am looking for is located at the coordinates (31, 0) and I am at 47 meters above the ground, so I will need to move closer to it to ensure it is visible and distinguishable as the person I am tasked to find.</Reasoning>
