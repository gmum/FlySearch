 <Reasoning>With the current altitude of 93 meters, there is still a significant amount of height to lose to get closer to the ground for a thorough search. I will start by flying 12 meters down to get a closer view. There's a point (-62, 31) in the grid which seems to be a good starting point for my search.</Reasoning>
