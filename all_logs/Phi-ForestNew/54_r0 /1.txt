 <Reasoning>At 90 meters, I'm not far enough down to ensure I'm as close to the ground as possible. I need to lower my altitude further to increase the chances of spotting the person. A decrease of 10 meters should suffice, considering my current position and the goal to be 8 meters below the ground.</Reasoning>
