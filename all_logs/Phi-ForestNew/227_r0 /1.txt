The drone is flying over a land area with trees and other vegetation, and the coordinates on the grid are displayed on the image. The drone is parked at the coordinates (48, 48). Since there is no object of interest detected at these coordinates, the drone needs to explore the area further.

The drone should move towards the (0, 47) coordinates, as it is the closest in the north direction. This move will ensure that the drone covers as much area as possible without going too far away from the parked position.

After the drone lands at (0, 47), it should fly to the (24, 47) coordinates. This is a significant move in the east direction and will cover a considerable portion of the eastern area.

Once the drone is at the (24, 47) coordinates, it should move down to the (0, 24) coordinates. This will ensure that the drone is at a lower altitude and closer to the ground.

Since the coordinates do
