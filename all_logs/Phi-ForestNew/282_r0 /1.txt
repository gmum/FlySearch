 <Reasoning>The object with coordinates (0, 0) is still present at the center of the image, but the drone is at 25 meters altitude. To get closer, I need to descend by 25 meters while also considering the 8 meters altitude change required to be closer. I will move downward by 17 meters to get closer to the object without going below drone's altitude.</Reasoning>
