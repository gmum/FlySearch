 <Reasoning>The object with coordinates (0, 0) is no longer in the immediate center of the image. To find the object, I need to move using the coordinates that are closest to it and then adjust my altitude to be closer. I will move up by 5 meters and then down by 8 meters to get closer to the object.</Reasoning>
