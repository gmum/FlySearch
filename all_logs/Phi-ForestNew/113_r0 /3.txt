 <Reasoning>At (3, 3), the coordinates are not optimal for a detailed search. I will move to a better position to have a clearer view of the potential fire.</Reasoning>
<Action>(2, 3, -5)</Action>

<Reasoning>The coordinates have been updated to (2, 3, -5), which allows me to look more closely at the right side of the image.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-1, 3, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>The coordinates are now at (-1, 3, -10), which gives a wider view of the area, but no clear fire is visible. I will continue to search for the fire.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-5, 3, -15)</Action>

<Reasoning>The coordinates have been adjusted to (-5, 3, -15), and I can clearly see an area with intense orange coloration, indicating the presence of the forest fire.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-5, 3, -20)</Action>

<Reasoning>I am now at the coordinates (-5, 3, -20), and I can confirm the presence of the forest fire below 10 meters above it.</Reasoning>
