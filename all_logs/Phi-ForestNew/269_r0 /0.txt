    The grid overlaid on the image indicates that the drone should move to the center of the area marked as the object. I will move to the coordinates (0, 46) and (46, 0).

    By moving to these coordinates, I am ensuring that I am as close as possible to the center of the area marked as the object.

    I will now fly below 10 meters relative to these coordinates. This should allow me to verify if the object is the one in question.

    Given that the current altitude is 69 meters, I will reduce it to the maximum of 120 meters before making the move to the object's coordinates. This ensures that I have sufficient altitude for the drone to maneuver properly during the search.
