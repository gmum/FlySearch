 <Reasoning>With an initial altitude of 72 meters, I will make a series of moves to progressively descend closer to the ground. This will help me to spot the trash pile as I am tasked with finding it. After each move, I will reassess my location relative to the grid and the surrounding terrain.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, 62)</Action>

<Reasoning>Having moved to 62 meters, I will then adjust to 55 meters to continue the descent towards the ground, which should allow me to get a clearer view of the terrain.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, 55)</Action>

<Reasoning>As I approach the ground, I will need to confirm if the area of interest is indeed the trash pile. I will proceed to 49 meters to make sure I am sufficiently low and can visually confirm the presence of the trash pile.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, 49)</Action>

<Reasoning>At this lower altitude, I will perform a visual scan of the area to visually confirm the presence of the trash pile. If the trash pile is not directly in view, I will adjust my position to improve my chances of finding it.</Re
