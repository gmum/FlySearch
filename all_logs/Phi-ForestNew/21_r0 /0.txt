 <Reasoning>I'm looking for a forest fire, which is indicated by the reddish-brown color. The coordinates given are (0, 0) and (31, 31), but they appear to be at a distance. I need to move closer to the area where the fire might be. As I'm not sure which point is closest to the fire, I will try moving slightly north to get a better view of the coordinates and if possible, the fire.</Reasoning>
