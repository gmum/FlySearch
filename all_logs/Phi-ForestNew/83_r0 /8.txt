    With the UAV at 1 meter above ground level, I will carry out a systematic search of the area, moving in a grid pattern to ensure that every potential location of the subject is covered. I will prioritize points that are closer to the subject's predicted location.

    As I proceed through the grid points, I will maintain this low altitude to maximize the visibility of the ground and potential signs of the subject. I will continue this pattern, making adjustments as necessary, until the subject is found.

    If the subject is not located at the grid points I have checked, I will move to the next closest point. This methodical approach will ensure that the search is thorough and that no potential location is overlooked.

    Upon finding the subject, I will adjust my altitude to be 10 meters below ground level to comply with the instruction. I will then begin scanning the area again for any additional subjects.
