 Given the coordinates of the potential object of interest at (0, 32), the first step would be to move closer to it while maintaining the altitude. Since the object is located at the positive y-axis, the best course of action would be to move directly downwards to reach the same altitude.

```xml
<Reasoning>
The object of interest is in the upper-right quadrant of the grid. Moving directly down will maintain the altitude at 48 meters and bring me closer to the object to confirm if it's within the search area.
</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 32, 0)</Action>
```

Since the altitude is not supposed to exceed 120 meters, and the altitude after the move is at 48 meters, it is within the acceptable range.
