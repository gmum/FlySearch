 The coordinates of the potential object of interest at (31, 31) are located to the right of the grid. To reach the coordinates while maintaining the altitude as close as possible and still be centered on the object, the best move would be to make a slight rightward move.

<Reasoning>
The object of interest is to the right of the grid, and moving right will take me closer to it while maintaining the altitude. This should bring me within the altitude limit and make it easier to confirm the object's presence.

This move is within the altitude limit of 120 meters and does not exceed the allowable number of moves.
