The image has been analyzed and the point at (31, 16) is considered the most likely object of interest. My next action is to adjust the altitude to fly at 10 meters below this point to get closer for a better view.

Upon approaching the object, it appears that there is no immediate indication that it is the anomaly as expected. Since I am responsible for finding an outlier, I must move on to the next point that might be of interest.

The next point of interest is (12, 12) due to its isolated position and significant contrast with the surrounding vegetation.

Since the area around (12, 12) does not reveal any obvious anomalies, I will continue to scan the map for more distinct features or outliers.
