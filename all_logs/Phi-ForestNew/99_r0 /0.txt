 I am the AI operating the UAV. My current altitude is 47 meters above ground level. To begin the search, I would first analyze the coordinates on the grid overlaid on the image to determine the best starting point for the search. Given the coordinates are not fully visible in the image, I would identify the visible coordinates and prepare for possible movement.


<Reasoning>
    The coordinates are not clear, but the visible ones are (31,31), (16,31), (0,31), (16,31), (0,0).
    Without knowing the exact start point, I cannot make a move yet as it's uncertain where the person is located.

    I have no visible coordinates to target, and thus, I cannot move the UAV in search of the person.

    The coordinates are not clear in the image, therefore I cannot identify the target to move the UAV towards.
