 <Reasoning>The object in the image is towards the top left corner, and it seems to be a white structure that stands out from the greenery. If the green area represents land, and the white stands out, it could be a building or a large structure of some sort. Since I am instructed to find an object that does not fit, and the coordinates indicate the drone should be centrally located above the object, I should fly downwards to get a closer look.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am still above the white object, not close enough, I should fly down further.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Still too high, I need to fly closer to the object. I'll fly lower now.</Reasoning>
