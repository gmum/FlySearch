I need to adjust my altitude to a safer level to avoid a potential collision. However, I also need to maintain enough altitude to see the building clearly.

The chosen move is to continue increasing my altitude to a safer level and to ensure I have a clear view of the landscape while searching for the building.

I have made 4 moves. My altitude has increased to 2.1 meters, but it is still below the recommended 10 meters for closer inspection. I will continue adjusting my altitude cautiously.
