I have made the necessary adjustment to my altitude to avoid a potential collision. However, it remains low, and I need to find a balance between safety and the ability to see the building clearly.

The chosen move is to continue increasing my altitude to a safer level while still being able to see the landscape clearly and to continue the search for the building.

I have made 2 moves. My altitude has increased to 2.1 meters, but it is still below the recommended 10 meters for closer inspection. I will continue adjusting my altitude cautiously.
