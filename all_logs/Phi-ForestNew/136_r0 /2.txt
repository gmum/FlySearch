I've flown too close to the ground and risked a collision. I need to adjust my altitude to ensure the safety of the drone and avoid any damage.

Due to the error, my altitude is drastically low, but I must prioritize safety. This choice is made to increase the drone's altitude to a safer level and to avoid potential hazards on the ground. I will also continue to adjust my altitude in a manner that reduces the risk of another collision.

I have now made 2 moves. My altitude has increased but still remains low. I will proceed with caution to continue the search for the building.
