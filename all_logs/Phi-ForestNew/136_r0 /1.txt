This starting altitude is an improvement from the previous 52 meters, but still not optimal for close examination of the ground. I will continue my search by moving to a location that is closer to the building.

Based on the coordinates provided, I chose to make a move towards the coordinates (0, -4) because they are closer to the coordinates (0, 0), which are the most likely locations of the building.

I have made 1 move. I am now 49 meters below the previous altitude. Given this new altitude, I am closer to the ground than before, but still outside of the building's area. I will therefore continue moving further down to get closer to the building.
