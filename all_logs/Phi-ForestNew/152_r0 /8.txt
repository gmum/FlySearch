Now that I am back at a safe altitude, I will proceed to fly through the area where the trash pile is likely located based on the previous coordinates. By doing so, I will be able to identify if the trash pile is within my field of view and if it is within 10 meters below the drone.

The trash pile is not within my field of view. I will need to plan my next move to ensure that it is within the search area. By doing so, I will be able to find the trash pile within the allotted number of moves.
