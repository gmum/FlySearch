 <Reasoning>
The coordinates given are within a grid overlay, which suggests that it is a search area for the trash pile. My reasoning for choosing my next move is to gradually decrease altitude to ensure that I can be reasonably close to the ground. By doing so, I will have a better chance of identifying the trash pile if it is located within the search area.
