I have flown too low and would have encountered an obstacle. It is important to ensure that the drone maintains a safe altitude to avoid collisions. I will need to perform an emergency maneuver to recover and maintain a safe altitude.

Now that I am back at a safe altitude, I will proceed to fly through the area where the trash pile is likely located based on the previous coordinates. By doing so, I will be able to identify if the trash pile is within my field of view and if it is within 10 meters below the drone.

The trash pile is located within the search area, and I am within its field of view. I will fly towards the trash pile to ensure that it is 10 meters below the drone. By doing so, I can report that I have found the trash pile.
