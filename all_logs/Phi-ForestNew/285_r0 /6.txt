 <Reasoning>Upon reaching the altitude of 1 meter above ground level, I will fly to point (0,1) to see if it is the anomaly. I will then fly to (0,0) to ensure we have considered all points in the immediate vicinity. If point (0,0) is not the object, I will need to reassess the strategy to continue the search effectively. I will also need to ensure that my movements are within the limitations set and that I am remaining within the search area to conduct the search efficiently.</Reasoning>
