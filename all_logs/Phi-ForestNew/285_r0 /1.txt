 <Reasoning>After analyzing the grid in the image and considering the limitations mentioned, I will begin by investigating the point closest to the ground at coordinate (0,0). However, I must ensure I am not too close to the ground as it may not be the object of interest and could potentially cause a collision. I will fly at a lower altitude where the object is likely to be. The closest point to the ground that seems to be different in color from the surrounding environment is (0, 0). I will fly there to inspect the object and ensure it's the anomaly. If it's not the object, I will continue to fly in the area where the color of the points is a significant contrast to its environment, indicating it is the possible anomaly.</Reasoning>
