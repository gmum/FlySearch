 <Reasoning>Having flown at a low altitude, I have detected the risk of collision with a nearby tree. As the object of interest is not within reach, I will stop immediately and assess my next move to proceed with the search. My goal is to ensure safety while still attempting to locate the object that does not conform to the surrounding environment.</Reasoning>
