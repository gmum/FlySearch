 <Reasoning>As per the given coordinates in the image and the objective, I will begin by analyzing the grid and identifying any point that might be an anomaly by its distinct features from the surrounding environment. Given that I am below the altitude limit, I will look for the closest point to the ground that stands out from its surroundings. I will avoid any areas that seem to blend in with the environment too much, indicating that they are not the anomaly. The first point that comes to my attention is (0, 0), which has a different color than the predominantly green environment suggesting it could be our target. I will fly there to determine if it's the object of interest.</Reasoning>
