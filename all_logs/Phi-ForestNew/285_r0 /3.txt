 <Reasoning>As per the given coordinates in the image and the objective, I will now focus on the initial coordinates (0,0) to see if it was the object of interest. From there, I will determine if there are any points nearby that could be the outlier. I must ensure I am below the altitude limit while searching for the object. If (0,0) is indeed the object, then the next target is to move to a point that is the closest to the ground but still is in the vicinity of the object to verify. I will then reply with "FOUND" once the object is confirmed. Considering the previous locations, (0,0) seems to be the object of interest, and it is best to approach it directly.</Reasoning>
