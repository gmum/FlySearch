 <Reasoning>It appears that I have flown too close to a point (0,0) and am now too low to continue safely. My immediate action is to stop and reconsider my approach to locate the object without the risk of a collision. To do this, I will change my altitude to a safer one by flying back up to a position where I can reassess and decide on the next best course of action. I will not attempt to fly any lower until I am certain that the UAV can move forward without violating altitude or safety constraints.</Reasoning>
