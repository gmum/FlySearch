 <Reasoning>I will first move in the direction that is located 12 meters south from the current point. Then, I will move 4 meters north and 5 meters west to get closer to the object. I must pay attention to the altitude and not go above 120 meters. I need to be cautious about the 400x400m search area and the 9 moves limitation.</Reasoning>
