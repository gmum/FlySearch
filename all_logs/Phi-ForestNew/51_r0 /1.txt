<Reasoning>The object seems to be in the center of the image, based on the coordinates I have. I will fly directly to it at a lower altitude, which is necessary to confirm if it's the object in question. If the object is still not visible, I will reassess and continue the search from a different direction to look for it.</Reasoning>
