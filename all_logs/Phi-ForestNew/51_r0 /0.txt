<Reasoning>I need to get closer to the object and decrease my altitude to have a better chance of finding it. Since the coordinates are listed in the format (x, y, z), I will move to the center of the object's coordinates without changing my altitude. I then will decrease my altitude by 15 meters to check if the object is visible. If it's not, I will continue the search.</Reasoning>
