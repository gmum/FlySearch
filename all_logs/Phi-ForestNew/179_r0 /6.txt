<Reasoning>I have reached my altitude limit. I must now wait and observe from the current altitude of 120 meters to see if the object shows up in the image, while still staying within the search area.</Reasoning>

I will continue to monitor the coordinates and reply with "FOUND" once the object is found at most 10 meters below the drone.
