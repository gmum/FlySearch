<Reasoning>The object is still not visible in the image. I will move back slightly to the left and continue the search, while keeping an eye on the altitude limit.</Reasoning>

I will continue to move in the search area and reply with "FOUND" once the object is found at most 10 meters below the drone. If the object has not appeared within the remaining altitude limit, I will reply with "NOT FOUND" and exit the search area.
