<Reasoning>I can no longer move southwest since my altitude just exceeded 120 meters. I will now move slightly to the right to stay within my search area while continuing to observe the coordinates for the object.</Reasoning>

I will continue to move in the search area and reply with "FOUND" once the object is found at most 10 meters below the drone.
