<Reasoning>The first coordinate on the grid seems to be surrounded by green areas, which may be an indication of vegetation. The second coordinate is surrounded by brown areas, which may indicate barren land or a different environment. The third coordinate is also surrounded by brown areas. It is possible that the object we are looking for is the yellow point with the coordinates (-48, -38), as it is surrounded by green areas. I will move to the coordinates (-48, -38, -11) to take a closer look.</Reasoning>
