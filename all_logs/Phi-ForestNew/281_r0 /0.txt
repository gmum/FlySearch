 <Reasoning>The drone is currently in the lower middle section of the grid. Since the object(s) are scattered throughout, I would first move towards a distant point that appears distinct to determine the general area of interest. I will then focus on the lower areas where the object's color stands out against the surrounding terrain. Given the high prevalence of greenery, I will prioritize the search in open areas where the object could blend in.</Reasoning>
