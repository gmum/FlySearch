 <Action>(3, -6, -6)</Action>
<Reasoning>The object is located at coordinates (3, -6), which is in the field of view of the drone. I am moving closer to the object to ensure it is within the search parameters. After confirming the object's presence, I will then assess if I am below 10 meters relative to it to fulfill the requirement of the task.</Reasoning>
