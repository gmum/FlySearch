 <Reasoning>
The coordinates on the grid show the object of interest is at a significant height above the drone. Since the drone is already at 66 meters above ground level, it's advantageous to decrease altitude to confirm the object's presence.

To be able to confirm the object, the drone must descend further. At the current altitude, it's still not at an appropriate height to identify the object.

<Reasoning>
The coordinates are not being actively sought out. The drone is high above the object and needs more descent to make an accurate assessment.
