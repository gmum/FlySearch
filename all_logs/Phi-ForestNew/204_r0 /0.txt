The text description does not provide any specific coordinate, but I will start my search based on the grid layout and look for the object that doesn't fit in with the rest of the environment.

Since no specific coordinates are mentioned in the text, I will make a general move in the center of the grid to start my search. I will also lower my altitude to get a closer look.

I will continue to move in the center of the grid, adjusting my altitude to get closer to the ground to better observe the surroundings.

I will continue to move in the center of the grid and adjust my altitude as needed to search for the object that doesn't fit. It seems like a bunch of trees are in the area, but I'm not sure if it is the object in question.
