    Since the object in question is at the coordinates (51,51), I will move to the spot on the grid that is the closest to (0,0), which is (0,51), to ensure I am within the field of view and can lower my altitude to search for the object. After reaching the specified coordinates, I will adjust my altitude to be 10 meters below the identified spot.
