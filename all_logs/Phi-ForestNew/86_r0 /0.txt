 <Reasoning>Since I'm currently at 58 meters I need to descend to get closer to the possible fire points. If I don't move, I won't be able to fulfill the requirement of being 10 meters below the object. I will start by moving closer to the center of the image where fire points are more concentrated.</Reasoning>
