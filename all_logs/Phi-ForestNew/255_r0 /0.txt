 Given the constraints and the coordinates provided, I am unable to perform the task as described. While the coordinates could be used to locate the object of interest, the altitude I am at (79 meters above ground) is not sufficient for me to be 10 meters below the object in question. Thus, I cannot make a move towards the object and cannot respond with "FOUND" as per the instructions.
