 <Reasoning>Since the building can't be seen from the current altitude, I'll ascend to get a better overview of the terrain and find landmarks to approximate the building's location. The building may be in the central region where the terrain appears to make a slight slope.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I can now see potential landmarks that might help in locating the building. I will descend to the closest landmark and adjust my coordinates to follow the slope of the terrain as it leads towards the center of the map, where the building is likely to be situated.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The terrain seems to lead to an area with a large open space that could be the building's location. I'll continue to descend to get closer to the building while keeping an eye on the terrain for any changes that could indicate the building's presence.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The open space is becoming more defined, and the building is within sight. I'll proceed to the building's estimated coordinates to confirm its presence.</Reasoning>
