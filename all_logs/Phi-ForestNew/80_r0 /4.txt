 <Reasoning>Starting from the coordinates (1, 0, 0), I will lower the drone to (0, 0, -10) and then move across the coordinates to carefully inspect each area for the object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>If the object isn't visible at the coordinates (0, 0, -10), I will climb to the coordinates (1, 0, 2) and continue the search systematically.</Reasoning>
<Action>(1, 0, 2)</Action>

<Reasoning>I will repeat this process, making adjustments as needed based on the object's location to ensure a thorough search while staying within the specified altitude limits.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -10)</Action>

<Reasoning>I will continue to scan the area, adjusting my location on the grid as necessary to gather more information about the object's whereabouts while keeping my altitude as low as possible.</Reasoning>
