    Given the starting point and the task to find a building, I will begin by moving towards the area with the highest concentration of yellow points, as they might indicate a more built-up area which could include buildings. This should increase the likelihood of locating the building. If the building is nearby, I will attempt to hover at its estimated altitude to locate it on the ground.
