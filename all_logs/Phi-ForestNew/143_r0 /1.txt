 <Reasoning>
Since the starting point is not within the yellow area, and the objective is to find a building, my first move will be towards the yellow points to scout the area. Once I reach the closest yellow point, I will descend to a low enough altitude to investigate for the building or any signs of it. If the building is not within the yellow area and not immediately apparent, I will continue to move towards other yellow points.
