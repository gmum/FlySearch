    The grid is overlaid on the image, and I need to find the object that does not fit. I am currently at (1,1) on the grid, and I will move closer to the object by going to (0,0) on the grid. This will bring me lower and closer to the object. I am aware that I need to be at most 10 meters below the object when I find it.

    I have moved to (0, 0) on the grid, which means I am going deeper into the grid and closer to the lower part of the image. The object that does not fit is likely to be lower than the rest. I will now move to (0, -1) on the grid to get even closer.

    I am at (0, -1) on the grid, and it looks like the object might be to the right of the grid's center. I will move to (0, -2) to get even closer. The object still looks like the one I am looking for.
