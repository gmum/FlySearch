    I am at coordinates (0,0), and the object that does not fit is likely to be at a lower altitude. I will move to (0, -1) to get even closer to the object and have more vertical search area to find it.

    After moving to (0, -1), I am closer to the object. However, it is not easy to see it clearly yet. I will move to (0, -2) to zoom in even more and find the object.
