 <Reasoning>With the current altitude being 51 meters, it's higher than the ideal altitude for spotting trash piles. I'll decrease my altitude while moving to a cluster of points that could represent trash piles given their concentration.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Finally, I will get down to a safer altitude to avoid being too high and to confirm the spotting of the trash pile.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Assuming a spot is located, I must stay below 10 meters in altitude to comply with the objective. The coordinates I've chosen should place me at a low altitude above the potential trash pile.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I have reached a lower altitude and am now within the search zone. I need to analyze the area carefully for the presence of a trash pile.</Reasoning>
