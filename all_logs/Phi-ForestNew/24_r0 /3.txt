 <Reasoning>Since the altitude is 77 meters, which is above the ideal altitude for spotting trash piles, I need to make a move to descend to a suitable altitude for the search.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-32, -30, 17)</Action>

<Reasoning>I need to choose coordinates that are lower than my current altitude to stay within the parameter of being low enough to spot the trash pile.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-25, -30, 14)</Action>

<Reasoning>The coordinates chosen are within the search area. I must now be prepared to confirm the presence of the trash pile and respond accordingly.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-25, -29, 10)</Action>

<Reasoning>I am now in the correct altitude range to spot the trash pile. I need to carefully scan the area to ensure I find it.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-25, -30, 9)</Action>

<Reasoning>Given that the coordinates are now within the necessary altitude range, I should be able to spot the trash pile and report my findings.</Reasoning>
