I will start by descending to gain a closer perspective of the area where the rectangular and square objects are located. They could potentially be part of the campsite. The coordinates (0, 0) seem to be a good reference point to begin my search.

I am now 10 meters lower than my starting altitude, which should give me a better view of the ground below, increasing the chances of spotting a campsite.

Moving 10 meters south should allow me to cover more ground and potentially identify campsite features that are not immediately visible. The coordinates (0, 0) remain centered around for a systematic search.

Descending further to 20 meters below the ground level will help in conducting a thorough search for any signs of a campsite. The area around the (0, 0) coordinate grid point is likely to have relevant features given the green rectangular and square objects.
