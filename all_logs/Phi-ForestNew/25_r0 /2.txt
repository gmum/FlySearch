By descending to 5 meters below ground level, I will have a clearer view of the terrain and any potential campsite indicators directly below the starting point.

A movement to 5 meters south will allow me to cover more ground in the search for campsite signs, staying centered around the (0,0) coordinate grid point.

Descending another 10 meters will place me at a lower altitude, increasing the likelihood of spotting a campsite directly below the starting coordinates. This search is focused on the green area around the coordinates (0,0).
