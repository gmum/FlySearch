As I am tasked with finding a campsite, I will focus on the areas with signs of human activity, such as clearings or structures. The coordinates in the image are scattered, but a green rectangular area might indicate a campsite. To get a closer look, I need to adjust my altitude and position accordingly. The coordinates (0, 0) seem to be the starting point, and I will check the area around there.

By moving 20 meters down from the starting coordinates, I will be in a lower altitude, which increases the likelihood of spotting a campsite. I am centered around the (0,0) grid point, which seems to be a promising area to start my search.

Navigating 10 meters south of my previous position should help in covering more ground as this area might contain campsite signs. The movement is centered around the grid point (0,0) which should lead me to relevant features.
