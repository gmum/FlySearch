Moving 1 meter up from the current altitude will provide some buffer space to avoid the terrain. It's a safety measure to prevent a collision while I reassess the situation.

I will adjust my altitude to 0 meters above ground level, which should provide a stable flight position while I perform an emergency maneuver to ensure the UAV can safely continue its mission.
