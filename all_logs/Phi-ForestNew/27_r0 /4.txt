 <Reasoning>I'll move to the nearest grid point below my current altitude, which is to the southwest, to ensure I am closer to the ground and thus the object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(-6, -4, -14)</Action>

<Reasoning>Next, I'll move diagonally down to the grid point (0, 0) to cover more ground while remaining at a lower altitude.</Reasoning>
<Action>(0, 0, -16)</Action>

<Reasoning>Now, I'll move to the point (5, 5) to further decrease my altitude and cover additional area. This should bring me closer to the potential object.</Reasoning>
<Action>(5, 5, -15)</Action>

<Reasoning>I'll adjust my altitude to 1 meter above the object to ensure I am in a safe position to detect it. This is less than the 10-meter threshold but still close enough to detect the object if it's there.</Reasoning>
<Action>(5, 5, -1)</Action>

<Reasoning>I'll continue to move diagonally down to the grid point (10, 0) to further decrease my altitude and cover additional area.</
