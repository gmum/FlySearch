 <Reasoning>I will move to the nearest grid point below my current altitude, as this will bring me closer to the ground where the object is likely located. I'll also adjust my altitude to be 5 meters below the object if it's found below 10 meters.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Next, I'll move diagonally down to the grid point (5, 0) to cover more ground while remaining at a lower altitude. This will help in finding the object quickly.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>Now, I'll move to the point (10, 0) to further decrease my altitude and cover additional area. This should bring me closer to the potential object.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I'll adjust my altitude to 1 meter above the object to ensure I am in a safe position to detect it. This is less than the 10-meter threshold but still close enough to detect the object if it's there.</Reasoning>
