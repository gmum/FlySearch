<Reasoning>The coordinates (0, 0) are still within the same general area as before, which is appropriate for a detailed search in this location. I'll slightly lower my altitude to focus more closely on this spot, as it might be a potential area for the object. If this spot isn't the object, I'll move to coordinates (17, 17) next.</Reasoning>
