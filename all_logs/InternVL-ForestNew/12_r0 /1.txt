<Reasoning>The coordinates (0, 0) maintain the focus on the same general area as the previous move, which is necessary for a thorough search. I'm slightly lowering my altitude to focus more closely on the grid center, as this might indicate a more precise location of the object. If this area is not the object, I will then move to (25, 25) for further investigation.</Reasoning>
