<Reasoning>I am currently flying over coordinates (0, 0), which has a height of 0 meters. This is the closest point on the grid to the ground. To get closer to the ground and check this area, I need to descend. Additionally, I need to ensure I am centered over this point. To align with the coordinates (0, 0), I will move to the north-northwest to maintain my position over this area.</Reasoning>
