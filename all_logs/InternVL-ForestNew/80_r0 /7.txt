<Reasoning>I am currently flying over coordinates (0, 0), which is marked at a height of 0 meters. Since I am already at the ground level, I need to continue descending to ensure I am within 10 meters of the ground. This will allow me to thoroughly examine the area directly underneath me and check for the person.</Reasoning>
