<Reasoning>I have successfully located the trash pile at (0, 0). Since my current altitude is already at 1 meter, it is well within the required 10 meters or less above the object. Therefore, I satisfactorily meet the criteria for the "FOUND" command without needing to adjust my altitude further.</Reasoning>
