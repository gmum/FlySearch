<Reasoning>I need to adjust my position to focus on a different area of the grid. The point (0, 0) is directly below me, but given the potential location of the trash pile, I should move to the top-middle region, specifically (0, 27). This area might provide a better perspective for locating the trash pile, especially since itâ€™s slightly higher than my current altitude, which could help in spotting the object from above.</Reasoning>
