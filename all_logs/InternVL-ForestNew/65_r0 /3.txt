<Reasoning>I need to move to a point that will help me locate the trash pile accurately. Given my current position above the ground, I will adjust my altitude and position to the coordinates (17, 0). This point is centered relative to the potential location of the trash pile and will allow me to maintain a clear view for inspection.</Reasoning>
