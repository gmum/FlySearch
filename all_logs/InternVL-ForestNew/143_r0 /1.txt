<Reasoning>The coordinates (17, 0) have a positive altitude, indicating it might be above ground level. However, there are multiple occurrences of coordinates (0, 0) with negative altitudes, which could also be of interest. I will investigate the coordinates around (0, 0) to determine if one of them corresponds to the object below 10 meters.</Reasoning>
