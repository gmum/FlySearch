<Reasoning>The object appears to be at coordinate (0, 0) on the grid, which matches the coordinates from the previous images. However, since there's been no change from the previous grid and considering the object was not at (0, 0) throughout the search, it's possible the object isn't visible or has been misidentified. I will stay at the current altitude to confirm or reassess the search area.</Reasoning>
