<Reasoning>The object is likely to be around the point (0, 0) or (0, -12) as it appears to be near the center of the grid. My current altitude is 37 meters, and I should move lower to get closer to the ground and verify if it's the trash pile. Since the object is near the center, I'll move slightly south to ensure I cover the area properly.</Reasoning>
