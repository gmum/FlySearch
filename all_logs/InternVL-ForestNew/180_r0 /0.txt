<Reasoning>I currently observe a small structure in the center of the image, which might be the building. To confirm its position and altitude, I need to move closer. Since the numbers in the grid represent the direction in which the object will be centered in the drone's field of view, I will move towards the center of the grid to bring the structure into focus.</Reasoning>
