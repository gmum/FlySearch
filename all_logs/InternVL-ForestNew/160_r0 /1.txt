<Reasoning>Since the center point (0, 0) was not at coordinate (0, 26) in the previous move, I need to correct my position. Now that I am above the area with the coordinate (0, 0), I can start assessing nearby points to determine if the object is there or not. I will move to point (-22, 22) to check this section of the grid.</Reasoning>
