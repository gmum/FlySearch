<Reasoning>I am centered over (0, 0) and have descended to approximately 5 meters, but the object is not in view. Given the object might be at one of these coordinates, moving further north will likely bring me closer to the potential object area. I will proceed to this area to increase the chances of locating the object.</Reasoning>
