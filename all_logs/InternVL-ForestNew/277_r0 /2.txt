<Reasoning>The coordinates (10, 0, 0) suggest I am moving east from the center. However, this movement does not seem to reveal any anomalies or specific objects that stand out. Since the object could be in any direction, I will adjust my strategy and move south to cover more of the grid. Moving to (0, -10, 0) will take me directly south, which might help in identifying the anomaly if it exists in that area.</Reasoning>
