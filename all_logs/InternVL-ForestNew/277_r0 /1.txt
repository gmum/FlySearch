<Reasoning>I am currently over the coordinates (0, 0, 0), which is the center of the grid. To gather more information about the area, I will now move slightly to the east. This will help me cover more ground and potentially find the anomaly. The coordinates (10, 0, 0) will put me just east of the center, allowing for a broader view.</Reasoning>
