<Reasoning>I am currently over the object at coordinates (0, 32, 0), just confirmed as an anomaly. To ensure I am below 10 meters as specified, I will descend from my current altitude of 87 meters to 87 - 10 = 77 meters, which is still within the acceptable range. This will allow me to inspect the object closely without exceeding the altitude limit.</Reasoning>
