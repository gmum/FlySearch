<Reasoning>I am currently over the object at coordinates (0, 32, 0), which I have identified as an anomaly. To ensure I am within the required 10 meters of altitude, I will slightly descend to 76 - 10 = 66 meters. This descent will allow me to inspect the object closely while maintaining the altitude constraint.</Reasoning>
