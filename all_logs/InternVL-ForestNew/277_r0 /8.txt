<Reasoning>I am centered on the object at coordinates (0, 0, 0), which is confirmed as an anomaly. To ensure I am within the required 10 meters, I will slightly descend to 43 - 10 = 33 meters. This adjustment will allow me to inspect the object closely while maintaining the altitude constraint.</Reasoning>
