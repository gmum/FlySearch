<Reasoning>I am directly over the object at coordinates (0, 18, 0), which has been identified as an anomaly. To ensure I am within the required 10 meters, I will slightly descend to 54 - 10 = 44 meters. This descent will allow me to inspect the object closely while maintaining the altitude constraint.</Reasoning>
