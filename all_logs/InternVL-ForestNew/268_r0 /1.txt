<Reasoning>I am currently at coordinates (0, 0) with an altitude of 62 meters. To continue the search for the anomaly, I need to move towards the coordinates where the anomaly is more likely to be located. The coordinates (0, 0) are directly below and in front of me, so I will move slightly forward and down to approach the potential anomaly area.&lt;/Reasoning>
