<Reasoning>&lt;Considering the arrangement of coordinates and the nature of the anomaly, the object is likely to be the one with a unique value in the (x, y) plane, since height coordinates like (0, 0) are common. The anomaly seems to be at (0, 0), as it has a distinct height of 0 compared to others.&lt;/Reasoning>
