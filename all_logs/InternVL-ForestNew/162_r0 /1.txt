<Reasoning>I am currently centered over point (0, 0, 0) on the grid, where there is a significant amount of trash pile points. To ensure thorough coverage and increase the probability of finding the trash pile, I will adjust my position slightly to the northeast (towards point (19, 0, 0)). This will allow me to check the area more comprehensively.</Reasoning>
