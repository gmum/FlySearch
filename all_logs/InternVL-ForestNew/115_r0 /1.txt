<Reasoning>I am closer to the coordinates (0, 0) and will move to (28, 0) to gather more information about the area. This direction allows me to explore the vicinity of the potential object further.

Moving to (28, 0) will help me verify if this area holds the object and assess the need for a closer inspection.

I will continue my search once I am closer to the potential object to determine its exact location.
