<Reasoning>The coordinates (0, 0) are a likely candidate for the object's location, as it has a notable marker of "(0, 0)". I will start my search by moving towards this point to verify if it holds the object.

Moving to (0, 0) will help me get closer to the coordinates and begin the search process.

I will also decrease my altitude slightly to ensure I am ready to descend once I get closer to the potential object.

I will continue my search once I am closer to the coordinates to determine if it's the location of the object.
