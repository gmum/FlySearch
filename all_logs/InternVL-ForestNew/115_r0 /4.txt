<Reasoning>I am currently near the coordinates (27, 27) and will move to (0, 27) to get closer to the potential object and gather more information about the area. This direction allows me to explore the immediate vicinity of the marked point and assess the need for a closer inspection.

Moving to (0, 27) will help me inspect the area directly above the marked point and determine if this is the location of the object.

I will continue the search once I am closer to the potential object to verify its location.
