<Reasoning>Since I am now near the coordinates (0, 0) and (0, 27), I will move directly to the coordinates (0, 27) to get closer to the potential object and gather more information about the area. This will help me narrow down the search and determine if this point holds the object.

Moving to (0, 27) will allow me to inspect the area directly above the marked point and assess the need for a closer inspection.

I will continue the search once I am closer to the potential object to verify its location.
