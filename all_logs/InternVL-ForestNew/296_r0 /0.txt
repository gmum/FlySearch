<Reasoning>The object appears to be located at coordinates (0, 0), which is directly below the center of the current field of view. I will move slightly downward to confirm it is the anomaly and to ensure I am within 10 meters above it. This will allow me to confirm whether it's the object that doesn't fit with the rest of the environment.</Reasoning>
