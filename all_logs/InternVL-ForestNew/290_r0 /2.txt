<Reasoning>The object is still located near coordinates (0, 0) on the grid. Given that I am currently at a lower altitude (32 meters) and still need to get closer to the object, moving slightly northward will help me approach it more directly. This adjustment will ensure I am in the right position to evaluate the object closely in my next move.</Reasoning>
