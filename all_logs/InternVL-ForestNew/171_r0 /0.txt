<Reasoning>The center point in the grid is (0, 0). Since I need to perform a careful search and avoid going too far in any direction, I will start by flying slightly north of the center point. This allows me to cover more ground initially without committing to a specific location. I will move to (0, 0), -10 meters to start my search.</Reasoning>
