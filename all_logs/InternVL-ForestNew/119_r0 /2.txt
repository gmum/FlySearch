<Reasoning>The potential trash pile is now located at coordinates (14, 14) in the second image, which I targeted by descending 10 meters. In the third image, the coordinates of interest are (14, 14), indicating the object has remained in the same area. I need to move slightly downward to fine-tune my search and confirm if this is the trash pile.</Reasoning>
