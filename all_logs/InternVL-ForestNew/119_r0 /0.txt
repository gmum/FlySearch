<Reasoning>The potential trash pile is in the bottom left quadrant of the image, near the coordinates (24, 24). Moving downward will help narrow down the search area and bring me closer to the point of interest. I will start my search from this area to increase the chances of finding the trash pile.</Reasoning>
