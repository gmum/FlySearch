<Reasoning>I am positioned above the building. To ensure I am directly above the building and within 10 meters, I will move to the coordinates (0, 0), which is currently above the building at a higher altitude.

Moving to (0, 0) will help me center the building in my field of view and bring me closer to the required altitude of 10 meters below it.</Reasoning>
