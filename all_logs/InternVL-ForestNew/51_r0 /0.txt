<Reasoning>The building is located at the center of the grid, which is marked by the coordinates (0, 0). To ensure I am centered on the building and within a safe search radius, I will start by descending towards the center. Moving directly downward will help me achieve this.

Moving directly towards (0, 0) at a descending altitude will keep me within the search area and ensure I can centrally locate and inspect the building.

I'm starting my search by descending towards the coordinates (0, 0) with a slight adjustment in the x direction to ensure I'm on track.</Reasoning>
