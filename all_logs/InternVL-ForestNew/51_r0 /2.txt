<Reasoning>I am not centered on the building in my current position. To ensure I am directly above the building, I will move to the coordinates (0, 0), which seems to be above the building.

Moving to (0, 0) will help me center the building in my field of view and get closer to the required altitude of 10 meters below it.</Reasoning>
