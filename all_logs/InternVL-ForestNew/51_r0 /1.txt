<Reasoning>I am now directly above the building as indicated by the coordinates (0, 0). The next step is to descend to ensure I am within 10 meters of the object, while keeping the building centered in my field of view.

Since I am already above the building, I will adjust my altitude to 10 meters below the building, which should keep me within the specified criteria while ensuring I can clearly observe it.</Reasoning>
