<Reasoning>I am positioned above the building. To ensure I am directly above the building and within 10 meters, I will move to the coordinates (0, 0), which is currently above the building.

Moving to (0, 0) will help me center the building in my field of view and bring me closer to the required altitude of 10 meters below it.</Reasoning>
