<Reasoning>I just moved to coordinates (0, 0) near the point (0, 0, -1). To find the trash pile, I should move in the direction of the point (0, 0, -1) to continue lowering and search the area. This direction will help me get closer to the coordinates where the trash pile might be located.</Reasoning>
