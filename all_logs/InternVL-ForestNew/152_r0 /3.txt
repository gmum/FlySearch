<Reasoning>I am now at coordinates (0, 0) next to the point (0, 0, -1). To continue my search, I should move in the direction of the point (0, 0, -1) to keep lowering and potentially find the trash pile. This direction will help me get closer to the coordinates where the trash pile might be located.</Reasoning>
