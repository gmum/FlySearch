<Reasoning>The object could potentially be located at (0, 0) since it's in the center of the grid and has coordinates (0, 0, 0). It's also possible it could be at (34, 0), as it is in the middle row and seems significant. I need to move closer to these points to check if it's the object and determine the appropriate next steps.</Reasoning>
