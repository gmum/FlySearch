<Reasoning>I am now positioned slightly south of the fire's central coordinates, around (0, 0). To better align with the fire, I'll move east towards (14, 0). This movement should help me center more precisely on the fire, allowing for a closer inspection to determine if it's the object of interest.</Reasoning>
