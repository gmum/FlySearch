<Reasoning>The object seems to be located at (0, 0) or nearby since that point is the only one with a z-coordinate of 0. This suggests it might be at ground level or very close to it compared to the others, which have non-zero z-coordinates. The object at (0, 0, 0) is a potential candidate for the anomaly.</Reasoning>
