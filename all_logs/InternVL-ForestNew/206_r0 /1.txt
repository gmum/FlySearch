<Reasoning>Based on the grid and coordinates, the object is at (0, 0) and the coordinates around it suggest it's central. My current location is slightly to the south, so I need to move north to center over the object. I'll adjust my altitude slightly to ensure I'm close enough to confirm it's the object.</Reasoning>
