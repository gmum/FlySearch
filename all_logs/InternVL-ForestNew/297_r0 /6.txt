<Reasoning>The object is centered at coordinates (0, 0). Moving east to (0, 5) should position me directly over the object, allowing for a close inspection. This keeps me within the 10-meter limit for "FOUND" while ensuring I am centered on the object.

I will move east to align directly above the object.</Reasoning>
