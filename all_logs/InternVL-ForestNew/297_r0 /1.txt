<Reasoning>The object is currently at coordinates (0, 0). Adjusting slightly northward to (0, 5) should help maintain clear visibility without directly flying over any obstructions, particularly since the object is in the central area.

I will move north to maintain a clear field of view and prepare for closer inspection.</Reasoning>
