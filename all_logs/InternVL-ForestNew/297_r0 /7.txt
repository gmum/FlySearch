<Reasoning>The object is centered at coordinates (0, 0). Moving south to (0, -5) should position me directly over the object, which is ideal for a detailed inspection. This adjustment helps ensure that I am centered on the object and within the 10-meter limit for "FOUND".

I will move south to align directly above the object.</Reasoning>
