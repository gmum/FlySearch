<Reasoning>I am centered over the object at coordinates (0, 0). Moving north to (0, 5) maintains a direct line of sight and ensures a clear path to the object. This adjustment helps avoid any immediate obstructions and keeps me in a stable position for further inspection.

I will move north to prepare for a closer inspection from a slightly different angle.</Reasoning>
