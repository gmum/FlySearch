<Reasoning>The object is centered at coordinates (0, 0). Moving west to (0, -5) should position me directly over the object, allowing for a close inspection. This adjustment helps ensure that I am centered on the object and within the 10-meter limit for "FOUND".

I will move west to align directly above the object.</Reasoning>
