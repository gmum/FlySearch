<Reasoning>The target is likely located near the coordinates (0, 0, 0) based on previous information. Given that I am currently at 75 meters above the ground and need to descend to within 10 meters of the object, I will move to the (0, 0) location and adjust my altitude closer to the ground as necessary. This move keeps me on track toward identifying the campsite accurately.
