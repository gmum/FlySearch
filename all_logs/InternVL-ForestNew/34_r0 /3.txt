<Reasoning>I have identified the object of interest at coordinates (0, 0) and altitude (0, 0) in the images. The object appears to be the small structure in the center of the grid. To ensure I am directly above it, I will move to coordinates (0, 0) without changing altitude. This will allow me to get a clear view and confirm the object's position without overshooting or undershooting.</Reasoning>
