<Reasoning>The object of interest is located at coordinates (12, 12) in the image, which is the same as the one identified in the previous image. The coordinates suggest that the object might be the small structure near the center of the grid. Since I am already on the right track, I will move slightly upwards to fine-tune my position and get a better view of the object.</Reasoning>
