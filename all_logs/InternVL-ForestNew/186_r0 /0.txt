<Reasoning>The red area appears to be the object in question. I need to head in the direction of the red spot to get closer and verify it's the fire. Starting with a descent to around 10 meters altitude should be sufficient. If this isn't the object, I can adjust based on visual confirmation.</Reasoning>
