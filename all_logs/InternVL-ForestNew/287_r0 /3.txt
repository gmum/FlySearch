I need to adjust my position to align better with the central coordinates (15, 15) to continue the search for the anomaly. Given the current coordinates and their distribution, I should focus on the area near (15, 15) and slightly adjust my altitude to get a better view.

<Reasoning>I will fly towards the central coordinates (15, 15) to continue examining the area where the majority of coordinates are concentrated.</Reasoning>
