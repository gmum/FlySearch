I need to start my search by examining the coordinates more closely to determine the general area where the object might be located. Given the distribution of coordinates, the central location where the object could be is near coordinates (19, 19) and (37, 19), which is where the majority of the coordinates are concentrated.

<Reasoning>I will begin my search by flying towards the central coordinates and slightly adjusting my altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
