<Reasoning>I need to stay at (0, 0) to check the exact center of the grid, which is currently at (0, 0). This will help ensure I am close to the object if it is located there. Descending to 0 meters will allow me to closely inspect the ground level, maintaining the height limit and focusing on the center of the image.</Reasoning>
