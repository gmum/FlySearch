<Reasoning>I am still centered above the object, as it is located at (0, 0, 0) on the grid. To ensure I am directly over the object, I will move to this point while descending to 0 meters above the object. This will confirm that the object is the building and ensure I am within the desired altitude range.</Reasoning>
