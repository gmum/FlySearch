<Reasoning>The object is still at the bottom of the grid, which is at coordinates (0, 0), but the coordinates around this point are now (-0.0, 0.0), indicating it's slightly to the south. I will fly slightly south to confirm the location and adjust my altitude accordingly. Moving closer will help determine if this is the fire location.</Reasoning>
