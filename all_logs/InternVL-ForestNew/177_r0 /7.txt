<Reasoning>I have located the fire, as indicated by the red hue in the bottom row, centered at coordinates (-0.0, -0.0). The coordinates around it are mostly at (0, 0), suggesting it's directly below me. I need to descend to confirm the object is the fire and ensure I am close enough to it.</Reasoning>
