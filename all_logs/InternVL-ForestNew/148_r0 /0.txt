<Reasoning>I will start the search by moving to the center of the grid, which is around (0, 0) and slightly lowering the altitude to get a closer view. This will ensure I cover the area without taking unnecessary risks of moving too far from the center initially. This area has coordinates (0, 0), (0, 2), and (23, 0), which are at ground level and might be good candidates to check.</Reasoning>
