<Reasoning>Based on the grid and the coordinates provided, the most central point appears to be (0, 0), which is also the building location. However, due to the smaller structure at (15, 0) with coordinates (19, 31), I should move there to ensure I am not missing the object. I'll make a slight descent and shift to the right to closely inspect the building location.</Reasoning>
