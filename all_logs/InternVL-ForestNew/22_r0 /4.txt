<Reasoning>I am at (0, 0, 26) and need to move towards a potential trash pile. The coordinate (0, 0) is directly below me. I will move east to (9, 0, -10) to be centered over potential trash pile coordinates (9, 0) and start the search. This will help narrow down the search area and move closer to a potential trash pile.</Reasoning>
