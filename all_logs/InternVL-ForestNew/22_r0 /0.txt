<Reasoning>I am starting the search at the center of the grid, which is (0, 0). The coordinates listed are potential locations of the trash pile, so I will move towards the nearest one in the center, (0, 0, -10), to begin the search. This will help me narrow down the search area and potentially find the object more quickly.</Reasoning>
