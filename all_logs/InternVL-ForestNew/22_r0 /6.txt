<Reasoning>The current coordinate is (0, 0, 4), and I need to focus on the trash pile, which is located at (0, 0). I should move east to (1, 0, -10) to be centered over potential trash pile coordinates (1, 0) and start the search. This will help narrow down the search area and move closer to a potential trash pile.</Reasoning>
