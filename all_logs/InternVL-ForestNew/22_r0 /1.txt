<Reasoning>I'm currently looking at (0, 0, 59) and need to adjust my position closer to a potential trash pile. The coordinate (0, 0) is directly below me, indicating the center of the grid. I will move slightly south to (-20, 0, -10) to begin focusing on that area. This helps me center on potential trash pile coordinates and start the search more precisely.</Reasoning>
