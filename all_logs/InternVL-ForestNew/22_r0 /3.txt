<Reasoning>The current coordinate is (0, 0, 37). I need to focus on the trash pile, which is located at (0, 0). I should move north to (12, 0, -10) to center over potential trash pile coordinates (12, 0) and start the search. This will help narrow down the search area and move closer to a potential trash pile.</Reasoning>
