<Reasoning>The current coordinate is (0, 0, 15), and I need to focus on the trash pile. The coordinate (0, 0) is directly below me. I should move west to (-5, 0, -10) to be centered over potential trash pile coordinates (5, 0) and start the search. This will help narrow down the search area and move closer to a potential trash pile.</Reasoning>
