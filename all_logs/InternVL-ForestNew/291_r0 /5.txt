<Reasoning>The object at '(0, 0)' is the one of interest. Moving directly south will bring me closer to it, which allows me to verify the anomaly more closely and ensure I am centered on it for a detailed inspection.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am now directly above the object at '(0, 0)', which remains the point of interest. Moving directly south will bring me closer to it. This ensures I am centered on the anomaly for a detailed inspection.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>The object at '(0, 0)' is still the point of interest, and moving directly south will bring me closer to it. This will allow me to verify the anomaly more closely and ensure I am centered on it for a detailed inspection.</Reasoning>

<Reasoning>I am directly above the object at '(0, 0)', which remains the point of interest. Since I am already centered on it, I will lower to a height of 10 meters to verify the anomaly more closely.</Reasoning>
