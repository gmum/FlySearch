<Reasoning>I am now closer to the point marked '(0, 0)' and it still appears to be an anomaly due to its low coordinates. It is slightly to the west of my current position. I need to move more to the west to align with this point and check more closely. I will fly west to align with the anomaly and verify it further.</Reasoning>
