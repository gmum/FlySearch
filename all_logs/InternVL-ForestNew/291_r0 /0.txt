<Reasoning>The object that stands out due to its unusually low coordinates (close to (0,0)) could be the anomaly. It is marked as '(0, 0)' and is located slightly to the south of the center. I need to move closer to this point to verify if it is the anomaly. I will fly south to align with this point and check more closely.</Reasoning>
