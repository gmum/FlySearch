<Reasoning>I will start by moving towards the point (-26, 52), as it is the first location in the grid to the north and slightly east. This will help me narrow down the search area towards the top of the image. Since we are not at the object yet, I will maintain a higher altitude to cover more area efficiently.</Reasoning>
