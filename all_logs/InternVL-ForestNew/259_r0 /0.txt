<Reasoning>I am starting the search from the center of the grid, which contains coordinates (0, 0). This central point has a coordinate of (0, 0, 0), indicating it is at ground level. I need to explore this area closely to determine if it's the anomaly. Since the current altitude is 47 meters, I should start by descending to ground level or slightly above to get a detailed view.</Reasoning>
