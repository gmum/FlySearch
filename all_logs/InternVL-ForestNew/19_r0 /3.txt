<Reasoning>I need to move to the coordinates (0, 43, 0) to approach the potential building at (0, 43) which is within my field of view and closer than my current position. This move allows me to lower and investigate the location effectively. It keeps my search strategy on track by staying focused on the most promising location based on the current image.</Reasoning>
