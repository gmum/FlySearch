<Reasoning>The coordinates (0, 0, -5) have been chosen as they allow me to approach the potential building at (0, 0) while staying within the search area's boundaries. Moving to this location will enable me to lower and investigate the potential location effectively. This move ensures I remain focused on the most promising location based on the current grid coordinates.</Reasoning>
