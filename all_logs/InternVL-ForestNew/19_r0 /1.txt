<Reasoning>I need to move closer to the potential building location at (-21, 43) as it is now within my field of view and closer than my starting point. Moving to this location will allow me to begin the process of lowering and checking if it is the object I'm searching for. This move ensures I am strategically positioning myself to investigate the potential location effectively.</Reasoning>
