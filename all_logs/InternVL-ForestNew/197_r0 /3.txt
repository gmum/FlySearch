<Reasoning>The object is located at coordinates (10, 10), which is marked by the coordinates (10, 10) with a dot. Since my current altitude is 30 meters, which is above 10 meters, I need to descend to ensure I am within the required altitude limit and directly above the object.

I will move to the coordinates (10, 10) and descend to 10 meters altitude.</Reasoning>
