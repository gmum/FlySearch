<Reasoning>The object is still located at coordinates (39, 39). Since I am already at the correct coordinates, I don't need to move horizontally. To ensure I am directly over the object and within 10 meters, I will descend to 10 meters altitude.

I will now move directly downward to 10 meters while staying centered over the coordinates (39, 39).</Reasoning>
