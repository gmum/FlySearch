<Reasoning>The object is located at coordinates (39, 39), which is indicated by the coordinates (39, 39) with an "X" marker. The current altitude of 58 meters is lower than 10 meters, so I need to move closer to confirm it's the campsite and ensure I am directly above it.

I will adjust my position to be exactly above the coordinates (39, 39) to confirm it is the object. If it's confirmed, I will descend to 10 meters or less to finalize the search. If it's not the object, I'll continue searching based on further instructions.</Reasoning>
