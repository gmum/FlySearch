<Reasoning>The object is located at coordinates (0, 3), which is marked by the coordinates (0, 3) with a dot. Since I am already at the correct coordinates, I don't need to move horizontally. I am currently at the correct altitude of 10 meters, so I am within the required limit.

Given that the object is in my field of view and I am centered on it, I will proceed to confirm the object by staying still or moving slightly to maintain focus.</Reasoning>
