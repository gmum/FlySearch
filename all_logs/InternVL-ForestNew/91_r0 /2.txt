<Reasoning>The object seems to be centered at the coordinate (0, 0), surrounded closely by the coordinates (0, 5), (5, 0), and (5, 5). Given the current altitude of 15 meters and the pivotal position of (0, 0) as the center, I will move closer to (0, 0) to ensure Iâ€™m examining it from a perspective where it is likely the most central within the search area. Moving towards (5, 0) at a slight descent will help focus on the central object.</Reasoning>
