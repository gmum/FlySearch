<Reasoning>The object appears to be directly under the coordinate (0, 0), surrounded by the coordinates (3, 3), (7, 3), and (0, 7). Given the current altitude is 10 meters, moving a little higher to ensure I'm not obstructed by the tree canopy might be necessary. I will move slightly upwards to better assess the area around the coordinates (0, 0), (3, 3), and (7, 3).</Reasoning>
