<Reasoning>I am currently looking at the coordinates (0, 0) where the object is located. To confirm if it's the anomaly, I need to move slightly closer to ensure I am centered on the object. Since I am already fairly close, I will not change altitude but position slightly to ensure I am centered.</Reasoning>
