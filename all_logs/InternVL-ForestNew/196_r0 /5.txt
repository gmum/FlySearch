<Reasoning>I am now within visual range of the fire, which is centered around the coordinates (0, 0). To ensure I am within 10 meters of the object and to confirm I am close enough, I need to descend further. This movement will help me center on the object and be positioned directly above it, ensuring I am ready to declare "FOUND" if I am within the required distance.</Reasoning>
