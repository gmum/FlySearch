<Reasoning>The object is located at (0, 0), and I need to move closer to this area. Being higher will help me get a better view of the surroundings and possibly spot the object. I will first move slightly north to improve visibility and then descend to a lower altitude.

<Reasoning>I have descended to a height where I am directly over the object and can confirm its position. It is located at (0, 0), and I am now below 10 meters relative to it.
