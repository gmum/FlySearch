<Reasoning>The object appears to be centered around the point labeled (12, 12) on the grid, which corresponds to the coordinates (12.0, 12.0). I need to move closer to this location and lower in altitude to verify if this is the building. Since I'm higher than 10 meters, I will move to the point (12, 12) and then descend to 10 meters to check for the object.</Reasoning>
