<Reasoning>I have reached coordinates (-0.0, 0.0), which is near the initial spot of the object noted at (0, 0) in the grid. However, the object appears to be over a cluster of rocks, which might obstruct my view. To improve visibility and ensure the object is in my field of view, I will slightly adjust my position to the northeast of this location.</Reasoning>
