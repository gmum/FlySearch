<Reasoning>I am currently directly above the fire at coordinates (0, 0), which is the object I am looking for. To verify and ensure I am within the required altitude range, I need to descend slightly to get closer without exceeding the 10-meter limit. This adjustment will help me confirm that I am within the correct proximity to the fire.</Reasoning>
