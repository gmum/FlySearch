I can see what appears to be a small blue marker in the image, slightly west and south of the center point (0,0). Since I need to search for a campsite and get closer to investigate, I'll move towards that area and significantly reduce altitude to get a better view. I'll aim for coordinates near (-29, -29) and drop down by 60 meters to get closer to the ground.
