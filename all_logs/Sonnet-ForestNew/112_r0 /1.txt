From this lower altitude of 43 meters, I can see more detail but still no clear sign of the person. I notice there are some clearings in the vegetation where a person might be easier to spot. I'll move to the northeast quadrant (14, 14) where there appears to be more open ground, and continue descending to get an even better view. I'll drop another 20 meters in altitude.
