I need to start a systematic search pattern to find the person. From my current altitude of 74 meters, I can see a good portion of the area, but it's too high to spot details clearly. I'll start by moving to a more central position and reducing altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) which is the center of the grid, and descend by 30 meters to get a clearer view while still maintaining enough height to survey the area.
