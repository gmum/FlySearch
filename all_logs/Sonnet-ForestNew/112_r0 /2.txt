At 22 meters altitude, I have a much clearer view of the terrain. I can see what appears to be some movement or an object near coordinates (7, 7). I'll move to that location and descend further to get a closer look, dropping to 8 meters which will put me under the required 10-meter threshold if this is indeed our target.
