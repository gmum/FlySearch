I need to systematically search the area for the trash pile. From this altitude (42m), I can see a good portion of the area but might miss smaller details. I'll first move to a central position and lower my altitude to get a better view. I'll go to coordinates (0, 0) and decrease altitude by 20 meters to get a clearer view of the ground while maintaining enough height to continue searching if needed.
