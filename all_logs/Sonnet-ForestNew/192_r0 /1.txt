From this lower altitude, I can see more detail but still no clear sign of the person. I notice something that might be of interest in the lower right quadrant of the image. I'll move towards coordinates (10, -10) and lower the altitude further to get a better look at that area. This will put me at about 15 meters altitude which should give me a much clearer view while still maintaining enough height to scan effectively.
