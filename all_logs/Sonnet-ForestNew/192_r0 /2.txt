At this lower altitude, I can see more detail of the area. I notice something near coordinates (5, 0) that requires closer inspection. I'll move to that position and lower slightly to get a better view, but still maintain enough altitude to keep the area in my field of view. Going down another 5 meters will put me at 9 meters, which is within our target altitude of below 10 meters.
