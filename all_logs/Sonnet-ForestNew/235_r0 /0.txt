<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a circular metallic or concrete structure near the coordinates (-14, -14) that seems out of place in this natural environment. It looks like an artificial object that doesn't fit with the surrounding grassland and trees. I'll move towards it and decrease altitude to get a better look.</Reasoning>
