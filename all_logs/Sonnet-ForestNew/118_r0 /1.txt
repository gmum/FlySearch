From this lower altitude of 52m, I can see the terrain more clearly. I notice some open areas where it would be easier to spot an object. I'll continue descending while moving slightly towards coordinate (17, 17) where there appears to be a clearer area. I'll reduce altitude by another 30 meters to get a closer look.
