<Reasoning>
From this altitude of 94 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. I'll start by moving to the center position (0, 0) and reducing altitude significantly to get a better view. This will give me a central position to continue the search while getting closer to the ground to spot any objects of interest. I'll descend by 50 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to keep a good field of vision.</Reasoning>
