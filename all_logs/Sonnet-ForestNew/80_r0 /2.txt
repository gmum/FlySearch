From this altitude of 19 meters, I can see what appears to be a person or object of interest near coordinates (6, 0). I'll move to that position and descend to get within the required 10-meter range. I'll reduce altitude by 10 meters to get to approximately 9 meters above the target, which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters.</Reasoning>
