<Reasoning>
From this lower altitude of 44 meters, I can see the terrain more clearly. I notice some interesting areas in the southwest quadrant that deserve closer inspection. I'll move to coordinates (-15, -15) and continue descending to get an even better view. I'll reduce altitude by another 25 meters to get closer to the target height range while maintaining enough height to keep searching effectively.</Reasoning>
