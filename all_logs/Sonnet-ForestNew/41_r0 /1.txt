From this lower altitude of 29 meters, I can see the terrain more clearly. I notice some interesting features but still need to get lower to properly identify any potential persons. I'll move slightly towards the center-right area where there seems to be some activity or different ground patterns, while continuing to decrease altitude to get a better view.
