I'll start by conducting a systematic search of the area. The image shows a natural terrain with vegetation and some clearings. Since I'm currently at 62 meters altitude, which is too high to identify small objects clearly, I should lower my altitude while moving to scan different areas. I'll move towards the center coordinates (0, 0) and decrease altitude to get a better view of the area.
