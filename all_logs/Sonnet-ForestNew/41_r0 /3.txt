<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly positioned above the target at coordinates (0, 3) and at an altitude of 7 meters, which is well within our requirement of being below 10 meters. The target is clearly visible in the center of my field of view, meeting all the mission requirements:
1. Altitude is below 10 meters (at 7 meters)
2. Target is in field of view
3. Drone is centered on the target
