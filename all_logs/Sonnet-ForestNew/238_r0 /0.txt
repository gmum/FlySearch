<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small blue pool or water body at coordinates near (0, -14) which seems out of place in this natural environment. Since this could be our anomaly, I'll move closer to it and reduce altitude to get a better view. I'll position myself directly above it and descend to about 8 meters to ensure I'm within the 10-meter requirement.</Reasoning>
