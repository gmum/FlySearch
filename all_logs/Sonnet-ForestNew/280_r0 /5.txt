<Reasoning>
I can now see a clear artificial object or marking near coordinates (0, -3) that appears orange/yellow in color. It stands out distinctly from the natural vegetation and terrain. I'm already at 8 meters altitude which is perfect (below 10 meters), so I'll center directly over it for final confirmation.
