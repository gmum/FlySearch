I need to perform a systematic search for any anomalies in the environment. From this altitude, I can see the general area but might miss smaller details. I notice there's a yellowish patch near coordinates (0, 0). To get a better look, I'll move to that position and decrease altitude significantly to about 30 meters to get a clearer view of what might be there.
