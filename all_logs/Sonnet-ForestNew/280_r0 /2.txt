At this lower altitude, I can see some yellow flowering plants scattered around, but I notice there's something particularly interesting near coordinates (-5, 5) - there appears to be a light-colored patch or object that seems different from the natural vegetation. I'll move closer to that location and lower the altitude slightly more to get a better view of this potential anomaly.
