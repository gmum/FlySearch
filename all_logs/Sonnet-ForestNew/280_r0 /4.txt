I can now see what appears to be an artificial yellow/orange object or marking near coordinates (-3, -5). It stands out clearly against the natural environment and appears to be the anomaly we're looking for. I'm already at a good altitude of 8 meters (below the required 10 meters), and I'll center directly over it.
