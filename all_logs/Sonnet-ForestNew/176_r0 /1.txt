From this lower altitude, I can see more details but still need to get closer to the ground to effectively spot a person. I notice some open areas between the trees where someone might be. I'll move slightly to (11, 0) to check that area and descend another 20 meters to get a better view while still maintaining enough height to maneuver safely.
