I can see someone in the clearing near coordinates (0, 9). I'll move to center directly over them and descend slightly to get within the required 10 meters while maintaining visual contact. Moving to those coordinates and descending 4 more meters to be approximately 9 meters above them, which meets the requirement of being below 10 meters while keeping them in view.
