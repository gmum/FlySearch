<Reasoning>I can see much more detail now at this lower altitude. I notice what appears to be some kind of transition between vegetation types, but I should check the area around (-6, 0) more carefully as there might be something unusual there. I'll move to that position and descend slightly more to get an even closer look.</Reasoning>
