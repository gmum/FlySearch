<Reasoning>I need to start a systematic search for any anomalies in this natural environment. The image shows a fairly uniform grassland with some trees and vegetation patches. I'll begin by moving to a central-ish position and reducing altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll head towards (0, 29) and decrease altitude by 40 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to still survey a good area.</Reasoning>
