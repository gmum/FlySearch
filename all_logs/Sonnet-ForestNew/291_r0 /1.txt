<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see the terrain better but still no obvious anomalies. I notice some darker patches in the lower right quadrant. I'll move towards (16, -16) and continue descending to get an even closer look at that area. The descent will help me spot any small objects that might be out of place.</Reasoning>
