I can see a person in the lower portion of the image, near coordinates (0, -5). Since I need to get below 10 meters to meet the objective, I'll move to those coordinates and decrease my altitude by 8 meters, which will put me at 9 meters above ground - within the required range and still maintaining visual contact with the target.
