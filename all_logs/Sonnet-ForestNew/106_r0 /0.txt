I need to systematically search the area for the trash pile. From this altitude, I can see a relatively large area but might miss smaller details. I notice what appears to be a small lighter-colored area near coordinates (20, -41) that could potentially be the trash pile. I'll move closer to that location and decrease altitude to get a better view.
