<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a forest fire with flames and smoke at coordinates around (0, -65). I need to move towards that location and decrease my altitude to get closer to the fire, but I'll do this gradually to maintain safe operations. I'll move to those coordinates and descend by 50 meters as a first step.</Reasoning>
