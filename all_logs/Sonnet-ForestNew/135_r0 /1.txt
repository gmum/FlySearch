<Reasoning>I can now see the forest fire more clearly at coordinates around (16, 16). I need to get closer and lower to meet the requirement of being below 10 meters above the fire. I'll move directly to the fire's location and descend by 40 meters, which should put me at about 7 meters above the fire.</Reasoning>
