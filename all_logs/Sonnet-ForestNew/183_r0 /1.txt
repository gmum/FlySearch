<Reasoning>I can see the trash pile clearly now in my field of view near coordinates (3, 3). I'm already at a good altitude of 9 meters, which is below the required 10 meters, and I'm centered well enough to see the target. The brownish disturbed area is clearly visible and matches what would be expected for a trash pile.</Reasoning>
