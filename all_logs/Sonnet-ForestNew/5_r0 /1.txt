From this lower altitude (20m), I can see the clearing better, but I still need to get lower to ensure I can spot a person clearly. I notice some open areas to the right side of the image where it would be easier to spot someone. I'll move slightly to (7, 0) and continue descending to get a better view while staying above the tree line.
