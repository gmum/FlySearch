<Reasoning>I need to systematically search for the trash pile. From this altitude (85m), I can see a large area but might miss small details. I'll start by moving to the center position (0,0) and reducing altitude to get a better view. This will give me a good central position to continue the search while getting closer to the ground to spot the target.</Reasoning>
