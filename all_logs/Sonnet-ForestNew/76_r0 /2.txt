<Reasoning>I can see two blue tents now in my field of view. The one to the northeast appears to be the one I spotted initially. Since I'm already at the correct altitude (9 meters, which is below 10 meters) and I have the tents in my field of view, I'll just move slightly to better center on the campsite.</Reasoning>
