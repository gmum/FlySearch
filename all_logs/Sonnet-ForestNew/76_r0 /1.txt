<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a blue tent/campsite in the southern portion of my view. I need to move slightly to center it in my field of view. Since I'm already at a good altitude (9 meters, which is below the required 10 meters), I'll maintain this height and just adjust my position to be directly above it.</Reasoning>
