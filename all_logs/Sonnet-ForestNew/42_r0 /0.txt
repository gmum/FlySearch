From this initial view at 51 meters altitude, I can see a mostly green terrain with some patches of grass and trees. I need to conduct a systematic search starting from the center and moving outward while also getting lower to have a better view of potential objects. I'll start by moving to a slightly lower altitude and checking the central area first.
