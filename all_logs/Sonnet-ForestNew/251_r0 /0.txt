I need to start searching for any anomalies in the environment. From this altitude (90m), it's difficult to spot small objects, so I should descend while also moving to get a better view of different areas. I'll start by moving to the center-right portion of the grid and descending to get a better view of that area, as it appears to have some open spaces where an anomaly might be more visible.
