FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly centered on what appears to be a concrete or metallic structure that clearly stands out from the natural environment. I am at 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view. This matches all the criteria for a successful find: the anomaly is centered in view, I am below 10 meters altitude, and the object is clearly visible.
