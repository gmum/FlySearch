<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a blue circular object or pool near the center of the image. This seems to be the anomaly we're looking for since it's clearly different from the natural vegetation surrounding it. I'll move to position (0, 16) where the object appears to be centered and reduce altitude to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
