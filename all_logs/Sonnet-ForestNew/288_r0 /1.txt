<Reasoning>
I'm now at a good altitude of 8 meters, which is within our target range of below 10 meters. I can clearly see the metallic circular structure which appears to be some kind of reflective dome or dish. It's definitely the anomaly we're looking for as it's clearly artificial and stands out from the natural environment. I'm close enough and centered well enough on the object to confirm the finding.</Reasoning>
