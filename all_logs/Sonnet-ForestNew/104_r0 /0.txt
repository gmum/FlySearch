From this altitude of 38 meters, I can see a general overview of the area, but I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. I notice the terrain is mostly green with some patches that could potentially be what we're looking for. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering the altitude to get a better view of the details.

I'll move towards (0, 0) which is the center of the grid and reduce altitude by 15 meters to get a closer look while maintaining enough height to still have a good field of view.
