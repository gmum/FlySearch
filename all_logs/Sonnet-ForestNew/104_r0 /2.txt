I can now clearly see what appears to be a pile of old tires or similar circular objects in the center-top portion of the image, around coordinates (0, 3). I'm currently at 8 meters altitude, which is within our target range of being below 10 meters. The object is clearly visible in my field of view, so I'll move to center directly over it.
