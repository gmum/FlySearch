I can now see more detail at 22 meters altitude. I notice what appears to be something unusual in the lower right quadrant of the image, around coordinates (15, -15). It looks darker and different from the surrounding vegetation, which could be the trash pile we're looking for. I'll move to that location and lower the altitude further to get a better look.
