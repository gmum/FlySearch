<Reasoning>I have now used all available moves and was not successful in my mission. While I maintained the correct altitude of 9 meters, which would have been appropriate for identifying the fire, my search pattern was ineffective. I should have made larger initial movements towards the southeastern direction where we first spotted the fire, while still staying within the safe visible boundaries. This would have been a better strategy than the smaller incremental movements I chose to make.</Reasoning>
