I can clearly see several tent-like structures now. I'll position myself directly above what appears to be the main tent structure near coordinates (0, 0) and descend to get within 10 meters of it as required. The current altitude is 17 meters, so I'll descend by 8 meters to get to 9 meters above the campsite, which meets the requirement of being below 10 meters.
