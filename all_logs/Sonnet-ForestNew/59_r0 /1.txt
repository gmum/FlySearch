<Reasoning>I notice something that might be of interest in the southern section of the grid, around coordinate (0, -18). I'll move to that position and decrease altitude by another 35 meters to get a much closer look. This will put me at about 18 meters altitude, which will give me a much better view of anything on the ground while still maintaining enough height to maneuver safely.</Reasoning>
