<Reasoning>I need to start a systematic search pattern and get lower to have a better view of the area. I'll move to the center of the grid (0,0) and decrease altitude by 40 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively. This will put me at around 53 meters altitude, which will give me a better view while still maintaining good coverage area.</Reasoning>
