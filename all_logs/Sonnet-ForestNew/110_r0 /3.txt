<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a yellow pile/debris which appears to be the trash we're looking for. I'm perfectly positioned at coordinates (0, -2) and at an excellent altitude of 5 meters, which is well below the required 10 meters. The object is centered in my field of view. All conditions for completing the objective have been met.</Reasoning>
