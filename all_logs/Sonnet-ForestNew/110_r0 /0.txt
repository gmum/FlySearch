<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a brownish patch in the center of the image that stands out from the surrounding green vegetation. This could potentially be the trash pile we're looking for. Since I need to get closer to confirm and need to be below 10 meters to complete the objective, I'll move to the center coordinates (0, 0) and significantly reduce altitude to about 8 meters to get a better view while staying within the required height limit.</Reasoning>
