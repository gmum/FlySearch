<Reasoning>I can see a building structure near the center of the image at coordinates (0, -14). Since my objective is to get below 10 meters above the building and center on it, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce my altitude to approximately 8 meters to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining visual contact.</Reasoning>
