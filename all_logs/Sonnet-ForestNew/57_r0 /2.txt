<Reasoning>Now I can see the trash pile clearly in the image at my current position, and I'm already at a good altitude of 8 meters, which is below the required 10 meters. The object is centered in my field of view. Since I have met all the requirements - the object is in view, I'm centered on it, and I'm below 10 meters altitude - I can confirm the find.</Reasoning>
