<Reasoning>I need to systematically search the area for the trash pile. From this altitude (70m), it might be difficult to spot small details. I notice the terrain is fairly even with some vegetation. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view. I'll move to (0, 0) and descend 30 meters to get a clearer view of the surrounding area.</Reasoning>
