<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a dark patch in the lower left quadrant of the image, which could be the trash pile we're looking for. I'll move towards that location (around -27, -13) and reduce altitude further to get a closer look and verify if this is our target. I need to get below 10 meters to meet the objective requirements.</Reasoning>
