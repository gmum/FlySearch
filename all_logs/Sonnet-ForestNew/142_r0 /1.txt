Now at 34 meters, I have a clearer view but still need to search methodically. I notice some interesting features towards the northwest quadrant of the grid (-11, 11). I see what might be a clearing in that area that could contain a campsite. I'll move in that direction and continue lowering altitude for a closer inspection.
