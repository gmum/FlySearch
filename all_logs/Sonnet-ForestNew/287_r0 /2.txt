I'm now at a much lower altitude of 14 meters and I can see what appears to be something unusual near the (-5, -9) coordinates - there seems to be a small white or light-colored object that stands out from the natural vegetation. I'll move slightly southwest and lower my altitude just a bit more to get within that 10-meter threshold, ensuring I'm properly centered over the anomaly.
