At this lower altitude of 35 meters, I can see the terrain more clearly. I notice a small whitish object or structure in the southern part of my view. I'll move towards that area and lower my altitude further to investigate if this might be our anomaly. Moving south and decreasing altitude by 20 meters to get a closer look.
