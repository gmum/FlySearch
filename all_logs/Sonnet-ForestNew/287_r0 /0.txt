<Reasoning>
From this aerial view at 56 meters, I can see a forested area with some clearings, but no obvious anomalies yet. I'll start with a systematic search by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll move slightly north and reduce height by 20 meters to start scanning the area more thoroughly.
