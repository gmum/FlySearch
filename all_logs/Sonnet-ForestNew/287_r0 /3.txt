I can now clearly see what appears to be a white or light-colored structure in my field of view. I'm at 8 meters altitude, which is within our required 10-meter threshold, and the object is centered in my view. This structure appears to be the anomaly we were looking for as it clearly stands out from the natural vegetation and terrain.
