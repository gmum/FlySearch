I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. From the current altitude of 58 meters, I can see a general overview but need to get lower to identify objects better. I can see some variations in the terrain, but nothing clearly identifiable as a trash pile yet. I'll move towards the center-left area (19, 0) and decrease altitude significantly to get a better view of any potential objects of interest. This will give me a good starting point for a more detailed search.
