<Reasoning>
At this altitude of 8 meters, I can now clearly see what appears to be a trash pile near (0, 0) in my field of view. I'm already at an appropriate altitude (below 10 meters) and the object is centered in my view. The reddish coloring and unnatural accumulation of material confirms this is likely the trash pile we're looking for.
