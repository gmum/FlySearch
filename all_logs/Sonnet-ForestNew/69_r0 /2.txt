I can now see what appears to be fallen trees or logs in the area. I notice something that might be the trash pile near (4, 0), where there seems to be some unnatural coloring or material among the vegetation. I'll move slightly towards that position and lower just a bit more to confirm if it's the trash pile we're looking for.
