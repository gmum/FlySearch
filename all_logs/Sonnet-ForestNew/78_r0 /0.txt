From this initial aerial view at 84 meters, I can see a mix of vegetation and clearings, but no clear building yet. I should start by moving closer to the ground while staying near the center to get a better view of the area. I'll reduce altitude by 40 meters to see more detail while maintaining a good overview of the search area.
