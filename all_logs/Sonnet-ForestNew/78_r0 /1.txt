At 44 meters, I have a clearer view but still need to search systematically. I notice some darker areas in the vegetation that could be structures. I'll move to the northeast quadrant (15, 15) and continue descending to get a better look at what might be there. I'll reduce altitude by another 25 meters to get closer to the target height range.
