<Reasoning>
I can now clearly see the trash pile of what appears to be tires in the center-right of my view. I'm at 4 meters altitude which is well below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view. I have met all the requirements: below 10m altitude, object is centered in view, and I can clearly identify it.</Reasoning>
