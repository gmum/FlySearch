From this height and position, I notice a dark patch around coordinates (-21, -10) that could potentially be a trash pile. I'll move closer to that area and lower my altitude to get a better view. Since I need to be below 10 meters to confirm the target, I'll descend by 25 meters, which will put me at 6 meters above ground level - well within the required range.</Reasoning>
