From this height and view, I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. I notice some variations in the terrain, but to better identify any anomalies, I should first lower my altitude while staying roughly in the center area. I'll descend by 40 meters to get a better view while moving slightly towards the (0, 31) coordinate, which will help me search the northern section of the area first.
