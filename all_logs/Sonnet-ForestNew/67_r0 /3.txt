I apologize, but I notice that what I thought was a trash pile appears to be a large rock or boulder. I should continue searching for the actual trash pile.

<Reasoning>Since this turned out to be a rock rather than the trash pile I'm looking for, I should gain some altitude to get a better overview of the surrounding area and continue my search. I'll move towards the area where I see some different coloration in the left side of the image.</Reasoning>
