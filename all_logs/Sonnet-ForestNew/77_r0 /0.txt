From my current altitude of 40 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. The image shows a forested area with some variations in vegetation. I'll start by moving to the center of the grid (0,0) and reducing altitude to get a better view of the area. This will give me a more central position to continue the search while getting closer to the ground to spot any potential trash piles.
