I can now see what appears to be a trash pile near the structure at coordinates (-3, 0). I'll move to center directly over it and maintain this low altitude of 10 meters, which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters or at 10 meters relative to the object. The trash pile is clearly visible in my field of view and I am at an appropriate altitude.
