<Reasoning>I am now directly above the forest fire at a good altitude of 8 meters, which meets the requirement of being below 10 meters. The fire is clearly visible in my field of view, and I am centered on it. Since I have met all the requirements - being below 10 meters, having the object in view, and being centered on it - I can confirm the finding.</Reasoning>
