<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a forest fire in the lower left portion of the image, marked by bright orange flames and smoke. The fire appears to be centered around coordinates (-22, -22). Since I need to get closer and lower to confirm this finding and meet the requirement of being below 10 meters, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude.</Reasoning>
