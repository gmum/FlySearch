<Reasoning>I'm already at a good altitude (4 meters) and I can see the forest fire in the frame. The most intense part of the fire appears to be towards the right side of the image, around coordinates (3, 0). I'll move to center directly over that area while maintaining my current low altitude.</Reasoning>
