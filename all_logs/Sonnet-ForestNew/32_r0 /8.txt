<Reasoning>I can see the forest fire clearly in the image, with intense orange coloring. At 2 meters altitude, I'm already well below the required 10 meters. The center of the fire appears to be slightly to the right, around coordinates (1, -1). I'll move to center exactly over that position while maintaining my current low altitude.</Reasoning>
