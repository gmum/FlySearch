<Reasoning>I don't see any active forest fire in this image - I only see vegetation and some burned ground. I need to gain some altitude to get a better view of the surrounding area and continue my search. I'll ascend 30 meters to get a broader view while staying at the current horizontal position.</Reasoning>
