From this initial position at 48 meters altitude, I need to conduct a systematic search. The terrain appears to be a mix of grassland and scattered vegetation. I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while moving towards the center of the grid (0,0). This will give me a better vantage point to spot any objects of interest while maintaining a central position for further search patterns if needed.
