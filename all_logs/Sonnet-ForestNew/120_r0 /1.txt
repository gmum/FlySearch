From this lower altitude (50m), I can see more details but still no clear sign of the trash pile. I notice an interesting area near (17, -17). I'll move there and descend another 30 meters to get an even better view. This will put me at 20 meters altitude, which should help in identifying smaller objects while still maintaining a reasonable field of view.
