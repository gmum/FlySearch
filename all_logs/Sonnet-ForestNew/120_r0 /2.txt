At 19 meters altitude, I can see much more detail. I notice what appears to be a light-colored patch or disturbance in the ground near (-6, 6). This could be the trash pile we're looking for. I'll move to that location and descend to 8 meters to get a closer look and ensure I'm within the required 10-meter height requirement.
