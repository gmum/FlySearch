From this altitude (90m), I can see a wide area but it's difficult to identify small objects like trash piles. I'll start by moving to (-30, 0) and descending to get a better view of the central-left area. This will allow me to search systematically while getting closer to the ground to spot potential objects of interest. I'm choosing to descend by 40 meters to get a clearer view while still maintaining enough height to survey the area effectively.
