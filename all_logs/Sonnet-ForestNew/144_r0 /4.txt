<Reasoning>I still need to locate the fire that I initially saw in the bottom-right corner. I'll continue moving in that direction by going to (3, -3). I'm maintaining my current altitude of 5 meters, which is excellent for when I find the fire again, as it's well below the required 10-meter threshold.</Reasoning>
