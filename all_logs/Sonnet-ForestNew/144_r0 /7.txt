<Reasoning>I need to continue my search for the fire. I'll move to (1, -1) while maintaining my very low altitude. I'm extremely close to the ground now at 2 meters, which would be perfect for identifying the fire, but I need to keep moving towards where I last saw it in the bottom-right direction.</Reasoning>
