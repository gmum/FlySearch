<Reasoning>I seem to have lost sight of the fire. Given that I was moving towards the fire in the bottom-right corner in the previous image, I need to move back in that direction. I'll move towards (6, -5) while maintaining my current low altitude since I'm already at a good height for when I find the fire again.</Reasoning>
