Now at 38 meters, I have a clearer view but still need to get lower to effectively spot a person. I notice some interesting areas in the northeastern quadrant of the image. I'll move slightly in that direction (towards (13, 13)) and continue descending to get a better look. This will allow me to search that section more thoroughly while getting closer to the required altitude of under 10 meters.
