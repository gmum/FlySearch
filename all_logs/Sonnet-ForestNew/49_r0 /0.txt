From this initial aerial view at 79 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search for the person. The area appears to be an open field with some vegetation. I'll start by moving to the center position (0, 0) and reducing altitude to get a better view. This will give me a central vantage point from which to continue the search while getting closer to ground level.
