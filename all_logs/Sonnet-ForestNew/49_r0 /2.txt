I'm now at a good altitude of 9 meters, which is within our target range of below 10 meters. I can see a human figure near coordinate (3, 3). I'll move to center directly over that position while maintaining this altitude, which will give me the perfect vantage point to confirm the target while staying within the required height parameters.
