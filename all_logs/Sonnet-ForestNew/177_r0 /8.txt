<Reasoning>I apologize, but it seems we may have lost track of the fire location. We've reached our maximum number of moves (9) and haven't successfully relocated the fire we saw in the first image. We might need to try a different search pattern or direction in a new attempt. The current altitude of 2 meters would have been perfect for identifying the fire if we had found it, as it's well below the required 10 meters.</Reasoning>
