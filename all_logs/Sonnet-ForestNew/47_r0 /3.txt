I can now clearly see what appears to be a trash pile or debris area, and I'm positioned at 7 meters altitude, which is successfully below the 10-meter requirement. The object is clearly in my field of view and I'm centered well enough to identify it. Since I'm at an appropriate height and have the target centered in view, I can confirm the find.
