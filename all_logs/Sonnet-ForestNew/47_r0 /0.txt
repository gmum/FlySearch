From this altitude of 44 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. I see various patches of vegetation and ground, but no clear trash pile yet. I should first descend to get a better view while moving slightly towards the center of the grid. A lower altitude will give me a clearer view of potential targets.
