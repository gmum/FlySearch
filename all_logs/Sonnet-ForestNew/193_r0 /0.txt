<Reasoning>I can see a building structure in the western part of the image. Since I need to be below 10 meters above the object and centered on it, I should move towards the building's center (approximately at (-25, 0)) and significantly reduce my altitude to get closer to it. I'll aim to get to about 8 meters altitude to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining safe distance.</Reasoning>
