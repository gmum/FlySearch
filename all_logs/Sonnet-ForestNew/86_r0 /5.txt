<Reasoning>I need to gain altitude again temporarily to reorient myself and get a broader view of the area. While my current altitude of 7 meters is good for final detection, I'm having trouble locating the fire from this low vantage point. I'll increase altitude while staying within the safe bounds of the current view.</Reasoning>
