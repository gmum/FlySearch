<Reasoning>I need to gain some altitude temporarily to get a better view of the surrounding area and reorient myself to locate the fire again. From the first image, I know the fire was visible, but now I'm too low and in the wrong position to see it. I'll increase altitude while staying within the safe bounds of the current view.</Reasoning>
