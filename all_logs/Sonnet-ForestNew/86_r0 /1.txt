<Reasoning>I need to move back to where I saw the fire. From this closer view at 8 meters altitude, I can't see the fire anymore because I've moved too far from it. Based on the previous image, I should move back towards coordinates where I saw the orange flames. I'll maintain this low altitude as it's good for detection, but I need to reposition.</Reasoning>
