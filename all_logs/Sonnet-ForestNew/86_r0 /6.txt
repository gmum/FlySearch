<Reasoning>From this higher altitude, I can see a broader area, but I need to move further north and west where I originally spotted the fire. I'll move towards (31, 31) again but in a more deliberate search pattern, and this time I'll maintain a slightly higher altitude until I spot the fire again, then I can quickly descend.</Reasoning>
