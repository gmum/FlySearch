<Reasoning>From this higher vantage point, I can better orient myself. Based on the first image where I saw the fire, it should be towards the northwest direction. I'll move towards coordinates (31, 31) where I suspect the fire might be, while also reducing altitude to get closer to my target height requirement of under 10 meters.</Reasoning>
