<Reasoning>I have made all my allowed moves (9 moves) but have not successfully located the fire. This suggests I may have lost track of it during my search pattern or it may have moved outside of our search area. From the first image where we clearly saw it, I should have perhaps maintained a more direct path to its location. The search was unsuccessful within the given constraints.</Reasoning>
