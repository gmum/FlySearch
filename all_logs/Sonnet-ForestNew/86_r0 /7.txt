<Reasoning>I need to move further towards where I initially saw the fire. From the first image, the fire was visible in a more extreme northwest position. I'll move to (-17, 17) which is the furthest northwest point visible in the current grid, while maintaining enough altitude to keep oriented.</Reasoning>
