<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a forest fire with orange flames and smoke in the upper left quadrant of the image, approximately around coordinates (39, 39). Since I need to get closer and lower to confirm this is the fire and be within 10 meters of it, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude.</Reasoning>
