I need to start a systematic search pattern to locate the person. The image shows a wooded area with some clearings. I notice that the center area around (0,0) has better visibility, so I'll start there and lower my altitude significantly to get a better view. A lower altitude will give me a clearer view of the ground while maintaining enough height to still have a good field of view.
