I can now clearly see what appears to be an elephant or large animal near coordinates (0, -10). This is definitely the anomaly we're looking for. I need to move to center directly above it and descend to get below 10 meters altitude to meet the mission requirements. I'll move to those coordinates and descend by 20 meters, which will put me at 9 meters above the object.
