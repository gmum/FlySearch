I am now perfectly positioned above what appears to be an elephant, which is clearly the anomaly in this natural environment. I am at 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is centered in my field of view. This meets all the mission requirements - below 10m altitude, object in view, and centered position.
