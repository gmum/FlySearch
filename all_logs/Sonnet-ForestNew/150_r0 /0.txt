<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a trash pile or debris in the center of the image near coordinates (0, 12). I need to move closer to this location and reduce altitude to get below 10 meters as required. I'll move directly to those coordinates and descend by 28 meters to get to approximately 8 meters above ground level.</Reasoning>
