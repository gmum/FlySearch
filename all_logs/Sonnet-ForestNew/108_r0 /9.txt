Unfortunately, after searching multiple areas including open spaces and areas with distinctive coloring, we haven't been able to locate the target person. We've maintained a good search altitude of 8 meters throughout most of our search, which would have been perfect for identification if we had found the target. However, the person must be in a different area than what we've covered or possibly obscured by vegetation.
