From this lower altitude, I can see more clearly now. I notice what appears to be our target near coordinates (10, 10) in the upper right portion of the image. I'll move to that position while maintaining this altitude of 15 meters, which is already within our required range of being below 10 meters from the target, to confirm the sighting.
