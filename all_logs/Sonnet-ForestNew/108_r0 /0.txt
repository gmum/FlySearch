I need to start a systematic search pattern to locate the person. From my current altitude of 71 meters, I should descend to get a better view while moving towards the center of the visible area. I notice some variations in the vegetation and ground cover, so I'll start by moving to the center coordinates (0, 0) while descending to about 40 meters to get a clearer view of the area.
