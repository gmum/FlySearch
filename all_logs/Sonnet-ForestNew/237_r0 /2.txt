FOUND

<Reasoning>
I can now clearly see the anomalous object - what appears to be artificial debris or material that's clearly not natural to this environment. I am now at 7 meters altitude, which is well within the required 10-meter threshold, and the object is directly in my field of view. This position meets all the requirements: below 10 meters, centered on the object, and with clear visibility of the target.
