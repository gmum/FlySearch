From this initial view at 51 meters altitude, I can see a forested/bushy area with some clearings. I need to conduct a systematic search to find any anomalous objects. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll aim for (0, 17) and descend by 20 meters to improve visibility while maintaining enough height to keep a good field of view.
