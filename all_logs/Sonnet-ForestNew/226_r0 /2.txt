<Reasoning>
I can now see what appears to be a dark anomaly in the center of the image. I'm already at a good altitude (8 meters) which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view. The dark patch appears distinctly different from the surrounding natural vegetation and terrain, making it stand out as the anomaly we're looking for.
