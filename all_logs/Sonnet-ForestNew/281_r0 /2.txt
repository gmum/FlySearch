<Reasoning>
I am now positioned directly above what appears to be an artificial structure - it looks like a concrete or metallic installation on the ground. I am already at 9 meters altitude which is within our target range of below 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view and centered. This structure is definitely an anomaly in this natural environment.
