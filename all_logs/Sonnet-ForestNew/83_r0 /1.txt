From this lower altitude of 33 meters, I can see more detail but still no clear sign of the person. I notice some open areas where a person might be easier to spot. I'll continue searching by moving slightly to the north and descending further to about 15 meters altitude, which will give me a much closer view while still maintaining enough height to scan effectively. I'll move to coordinates (0, 11) and descend by 18 meters.
