<Reasoning>I am now positioned directly above the forest fire, clearly visible with intense orange flames in my field of view. My altitude is 8 meters, which is below the required 10-meter threshold, and I am centered on the target. This meets all the requirements: the fire is in view, I am below 10 meters altitude, and I am centered on the object.</Reasoning>
