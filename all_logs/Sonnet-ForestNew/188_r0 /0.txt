<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be smoke or a dark patch in the eastern part of the image, around coordinates (31, 0). This could be the forest fire we're looking for. I'll move closer to that location and decrease altitude significantly to get a better view and get within the required 10-meter range.</Reasoning>
