<Reasoning>I need to get back to where I saw the smoke in the first image. Since I'm now at the edge of the visible area and don't see the fire here, I should gain some altitude to get a better overview of the area and then plan my next move. A moderate increase in altitude will help me reorient while still staying well within our maximum altitude limit.</Reasoning>
