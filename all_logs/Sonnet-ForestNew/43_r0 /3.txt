<Reasoning>I see that I'm currently at 11 meters altitude, which is actually above our target height of under 10 meters. However, I notice I'm very close to some building structures, and I need to be careful about my movements. Given the proximity to the structure, I should first move laterally to get a better vantage point before making any vertical adjustments. I'll move slightly to coordinates (4, 0) to get a safer perspective.</Reasoning>
