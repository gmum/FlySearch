<Reasoning>Now I have a better perspective - I can see I was inside or very close to a building structure before. From this new position, I can see more of the surrounding area and part of the building. To complete our objective of finding the building while staying below 10 meters above it, I should move back towards the building's location but maintain a safer approach. I'll move to (0, -7) which appears to be near the building but not directly over or inside it.</Reasoning>
