<Reasoning>I apologize for my previous aggressive descent. I can see I'm currently very close to the building at 10 meters altitude. I should increase my altitude slightly to maintain a safer distance while still staying within our target height range of below 10 meters relative to the object. From this view, I'm centered on what appears to be the building. However, to maintain safety while still meeting the objective, I'll move up just slightly to 9 meters.</Reasoning>
