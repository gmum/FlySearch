<Reasoning>I can now see the building clearly from this position, and I'm at a good altitude of 9 meters, which is within our target of being below 10 meters. The building is in my field of view, I'm at a safe distance from it, and I'm positioned appropriately. This meets all our criteria - I can see the building, I'm below 10 meters altitude, and I'm in a safe position.</Reasoning>
