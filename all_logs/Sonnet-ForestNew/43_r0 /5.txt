<Reasoning>I appear to be in a very precarious position near what looks like the interior of a building or structure. Given that my movements keep getting stopped for safety, I need to try moving to a significantly different position to get out of this confined space. I'll try moving towards (7, 7) which appears to be towards the outer edge where there's more open space, while maintaining the same altitude.</Reasoning>
