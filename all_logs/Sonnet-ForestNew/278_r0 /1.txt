<Reasoning>
I apologize for the aggressive descent before. I see I'm now at 12 meters above ground level and have a clear view of the aircraft. I need to adjust my position slightly higher to maintain safe distance while still staying under 10 meters relative to the aircraft. Since the aircraft itself has significant height, I'm likely already at an appropriate relative height to it, as my 12 meters above ground level would translate to less than 10 meters relative to the top of the aircraft. I'm also well-centered on the target.
