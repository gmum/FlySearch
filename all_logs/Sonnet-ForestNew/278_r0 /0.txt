<Reasoning>
I can see a large aircraft on the ground which appears to be the anomaly I'm looking for - it's clearly not a natural part of this forested/grassy environment. Since I'm currently at 94 meters altitude and need to get below 10 meters relative to the object to properly identify it, I should move down significantly. I'll position myself directly above the aircraft at coordinates (0, 31) and descend to about 8 meters to ensure I'm within the required height limit while maintaining visual contact.
