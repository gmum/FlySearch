<Reasoning>I am now at a good altitude of 8 meters, which is below the required 10 meters. I can see the fire very clearly in the image, and I am properly centered on it at (0, 0). The intense orange and red colors confirm we are directly above the active fire area. No further movement is needed as we have achieved the objective of finding and positioning ourselves correctly above the fire at the appropriate altitude.</Reasoning>
