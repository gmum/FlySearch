I can see what appears to be a gray metallic object (possibly an aircraft or drone) in the center of the image. Since I need to get closer to inspect it and need to be below 10 meters relative to the object, I'll move down significantly while staying centered on it. I'll reduce altitude by 60 meters to get to approximately 9 meters above ground level, which should put me at an acceptable height for inspection while maintaining visual contact with the object.
