From this lower altitude, I can see more detail but still need to search systematically. There appears to be a clearing in the southeastern quadrant that would be worth investigating. I'll move towards (10, -10) and continue descending to get an even closer look at the ground level, as we need to be below 10 meters to properly identify any targets.
