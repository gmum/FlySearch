From this height and initial position, I need to conduct a systematic search. I notice there are clearings between the trees which would be good places to start looking. I'll begin by moving to the center area (0, 0) and reducing altitude significantly to get a better view of the ground. This will help me spot any potential targets while maintaining a good vantage point to plan subsequent moves.
