From this aerial view at 64 meters, I can see a mostly forested area with some clearings. I need to conduct a systematic search for the building. I'll start by moving to the center point (0, 0) and reducing altitude to get a better view of the area. This will give me a central position to continue the search while getting closer to the ground to spot any structures.
