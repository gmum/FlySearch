I can now clearly see a wooden structure/building below me. I am at 9 meters altitude which is within the required range (below 10 meters), and the building is centered in my field of view. Since I meet all the criteria - being centered on the object, having it in my field of view, and being below 10 meters altitude - I can confirm the target has been found.
