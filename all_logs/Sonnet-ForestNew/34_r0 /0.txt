<Reasoning>I can see a building with what appears to be a metal or reflective roof in the northwestern portion of the image. Since I need to get closer to it and be centered above it, I'll move towards those coordinates and reduce my altitude to get below 10 meters above it. Based on the grid, I'll move to coordinates (-25, 12) and descend by 30 meters to get closer to the target.</Reasoning>
