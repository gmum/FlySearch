<Reasoning>I can see I'm now much closer to the ground at 7 meters altitude, which is good as it's below the required 10 meters. However, I need to adjust my position to be directly above the building that was visible earlier. From this view, I can see it's slightly to the left of my current position, so I'll move towards (-5, 2) to better center myself over the target while maintaining my current low altitude.</Reasoning>
