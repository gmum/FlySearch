<Reasoning>
I am now positioned directly above the trash pile at 7 meters altitude, which is below the required 10-meter threshold. The trash pile is clearly visible in the center of my field of view, containing what appears to be various debris and waste materials. I have met all the requirements:
1. Below 10 meters (at 7 meters)
2. Object is in field of view
3. Centered on the object
