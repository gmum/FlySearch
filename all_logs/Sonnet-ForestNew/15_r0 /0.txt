From this height, I can see a forested area but no clear sign of a trash pile. I need to:
1. Lower my altitude to get a better view
2. Stay within the visible grid
3. Move systematically to search for the trash pile

I'll start by moving to the center (0, 0) and reducing altitude by 30 meters to get a clearer view of the area. This will put me at 42 meters above ground level, which should give me a better perspective while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively.
