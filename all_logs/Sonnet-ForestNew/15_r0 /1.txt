I can see what appears to be something unusual in the lower right quadrant of the image, near coordinates (27, -14). It could be the trash pile we're looking for. I'll move in that direction and lower my altitude further to get a better look. I'll descend another 20 meters, which will put me at 21 meters above ground level - still giving me enough height to confirm the target while getting significantly closer.
