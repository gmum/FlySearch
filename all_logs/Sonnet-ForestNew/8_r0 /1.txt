<Reasoning>
At 23 meters altitude, I have a better view but still need to get closer to effectively spot a person. I notice some variations in the vegetation but no clear sign of the target yet. I should:
1. Continue descending to get an even closer view
2. Move slightly northeast to check that area as there seems to be some interesting terrain variation there

I'll move to (8, 8) and descend another 15 meters to get to 8 meters altitude, which would put me within the required range if we spot the target.
