From this altitude of 54 meters, I need to perform a systematic search. I can see a relatively open area with grass and some vegetation. Since I need to find a person and get below 10 meters above them, I should:
1. First descend to get a better view while staying roughly in the center
2. Then perform a methodical search pattern if needed

I'll start by moving to the center coordinates (0,0) and descending by 30 meters to get a better view at 24 meters altitude.
