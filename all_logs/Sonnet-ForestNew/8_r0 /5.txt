At 4 meters altitude, I can now see someone in a clearing near (0, -1). I am already at an excellent altitude (4 meters is well below the required 10 meters) and I just need to center directly over the target. I'll move to that position and since I can clearly see the person and I'm below 10 meters, I can confirm the find.
