From this altitude of 93 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search while getting lower to better spot any objects. I notice some patches of denser vegetation and different terrain features. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude significantly to get a better view. I'll move to (0, 0) and descend by 50 meters to get a clearer view of the center area.
