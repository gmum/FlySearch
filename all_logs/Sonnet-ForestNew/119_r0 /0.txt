From this altitude, I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. The area appears to be a mix of vegetation and open ground. Since I'm starting quite high at 71 meters, I should first move to a lower altitude to get a better view while maintaining a central position. I'll descend to about 40 meters first to get a better overview while staying roughly in the center of the search area.
