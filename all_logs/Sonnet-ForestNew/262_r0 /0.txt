<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a blue circular object near the (-47, 0) coordinates. Since it stands out from the natural environment of grass and trees, this is likely our target anomaly. I'll move closer to that location and reduce altitude to get a better view and position myself within 10 meters of the object.</Reasoning>
