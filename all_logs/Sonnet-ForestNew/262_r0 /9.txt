<Reasoning>I seem to have lost track of the blue object. Given that we've made 9 moves already (reaching our move limit), and we're unable to clearly locate the target, I should report that we need to restart the search with a different strategy. The object might be just outside our current field of view or we might need to adjust our search pattern.</Reasoning>

[Note: We've reached the maximum number of allowed moves (9) and haven't successfully maintained a clear view of the target. A new search attempt might be needed with a different strategy.]
