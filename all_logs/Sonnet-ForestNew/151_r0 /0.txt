From this height and position, I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. I notice the terrain is mostly covered with vegetation and open areas. To get a better view while maintaining coverage, I'll first move to a central position and reduce altitude to get a clearer view of the ground. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) and descend by 30 meters to get a better look at the center area.
