<Reasoning>I need to back away to a safer distance first before making any other moves. Given the proximity to the aircraft, I should first gain some altitude and move to a position that's farther away. I'll move to (-8, -8) and increase altitude by 20 meters to get a better overview while maintaining safety.</Reasoning>
