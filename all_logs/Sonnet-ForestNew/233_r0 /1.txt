<Reasoning>I apologize for the aggressive descent. Now I can see we're very close to the aircraft. For safety, I should maintain a slightly higher altitude while still staying under 10 meters relative to the object. I'll move back up slightly to maintain a safer distance while still being under 10 meters above the aircraft.</Reasoning>
