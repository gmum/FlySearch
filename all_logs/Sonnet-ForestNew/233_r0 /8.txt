<Reasoning>Now I have a better overview of the aircraft from a safer distance. To meet the objective of being below 10 meters while maintaining safety, I'll move to position (-17, 17) which gives me a clear diagonal view from a good distance, and then descend to 9 meters. This position should keep us at a safe distance while still meeting the height requirement for the "FOUND" condition.</Reasoning>
