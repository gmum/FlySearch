<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an airplane on the ground, which is definitely an anomaly in this forested environment. The aircraft is centered at approximately (0, 0) in the grid. Since I need to get closer to confirm and be below 10 meters above it, I'll descend to about 8 meters above ground level while maintaining my position over the aircraft.</Reasoning>
