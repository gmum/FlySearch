<Reasoning>I now have a better view of the aircraft from 15 meters altitude. The aircraft is clearly visible and is our anomaly object. Since I need to be below 10 meters to declare "FOUND" but also maintain safety, I'll move to position (-10, 10) which gives me a good diagonal view, and descend just slightly to 9 meters altitude. This should keep me at a safe distance while meeting the height requirement.</Reasoning>
