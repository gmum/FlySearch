<Reasoning>Now I have a better overview of the aircraft from a safer distance. I want to position myself to observe the aircraft from (0, 21) which will give me a clear view from the front of the aircraft. Since I'm currently at 32 meters, which is too high for the "FOUND" condition, I'll need to descend but stay at a safe altitude of around 15 meters to avoid any potential collisions.</Reasoning>
