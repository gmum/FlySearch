<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a building or structure at coordinates (17, 0). I'll move directly to that location and lower my altitude to get a better view. I'll descend by 41 meters to get to 9 meters above ground level, which will put me within the required 10-meter height requirement while maintaining a safe distance.</Reasoning>
