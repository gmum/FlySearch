<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the building with a metal/tin roof. I'm currently at 14 meters altitude, which is still a bit too high according to the objective (needs to be below 10 meters). I'll center directly over the building at (0, -5) and lower the altitude to 8 meters to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining a safe height.</Reasoning>
