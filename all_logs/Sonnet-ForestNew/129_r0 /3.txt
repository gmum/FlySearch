<Reasoning>At 14 meters, I have a very detailed view of the area. I can see patches of yellow flowers and vegetation clearly. I notice something of interest near (-5, -9) coordinates. I'll move there and descend to just under 10 meters to get an even closer look, which should put me at the right height for confirming if the person is there.</Reasoning>
