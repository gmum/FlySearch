<Reasoning>At 33 meters altitude, I have a much clearer view of the terrain. I can see more details but still need to search systematically. I notice a slight movement or different coloration near the (-11, -11) coordinate. I'll move there and descend further to investigate, getting down to about 15 meters to get a much closer look while still maintaining enough height to keep a good field of view.</Reasoning>
