<Reasoning>From this lower altitude of 59 meters, I can see more detail but still no clear sign of the person. I'll continue the search pattern by moving slightly northeast and descending further to get an even better view of the terrain. I'll move to (20, 20) and descend another 25 meters to improve visibility while still maintaining enough height to cover a good search area.</Reasoning>
