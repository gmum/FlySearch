<Reasoning>I need to start with a systematic search pattern. From this altitude of 95 meters, I can see a good portion of the area but might miss smaller details. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) which is in the center of the visible grid, and simultaneously descend by 35 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively.</Reasoning>
