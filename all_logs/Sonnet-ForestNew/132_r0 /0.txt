I can see what appears to be a clearing or open area in the image. Since I'm looking for a campsite, I should systematically search areas that look like potential camping spots. I notice a promising area near coordinates (17, 17) where there's a clearer patch of ground. I'll move there and lower my altitude to get a better view.
