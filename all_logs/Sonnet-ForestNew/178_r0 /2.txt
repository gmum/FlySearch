I can now clearly see the building structure in my field of view. I am at 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters. The building is centered in my view, and I can see its details clearly, including what appears to be its roof structure. This position meets all the requirements: below 10m altitude, building in field of view, and centered on the target.
