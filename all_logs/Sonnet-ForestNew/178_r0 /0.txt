I need to start a systematic search for the building. From this altitude of 42 meters, I can see a good portion of the area, but I should get lower to better identify potential structures. I notice some darker areas with tree coverage around the edges, but I should focus on the more open areas first. I'll move to a central position and descend to get a better view.
