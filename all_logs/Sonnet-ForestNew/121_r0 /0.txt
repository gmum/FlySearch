<Reasoning>I need to systematically search for the trash pile. From this altitude of 75 meters, I can see a general overview of the area but might miss smaller details. I notice some variations in the terrain but no clear trash pile yet. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view. I'll head toward (0, 0) and descend by 30 meters to get a clearer view of the area.</Reasoning>
