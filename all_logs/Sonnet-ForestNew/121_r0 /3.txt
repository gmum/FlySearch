<Reasoning>At 10 meters altitude, I can now see a clearing with what appears to be a trash pile near (0, 0). I'm at an appropriate height and the object is in my field of view. The area shows signs of human disturbance with unnatural objects on the ground, which is consistent with a trash pile. I'm properly positioned and at the correct altitude (below 10 meters) to confirm this finding.</Reasoning>
