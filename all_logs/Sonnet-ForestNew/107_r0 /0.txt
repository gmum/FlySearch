I can see what appears to be a small building or structure near coordinates (-61, 31). Since I need to get closer to confirm and need to be below 10 meters to complete the task, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude to about 15 meters to get a better view. I'm choosing 15 meters for this move to be cautious and get a better look before going even lower.
