I can see a building more clearly now. It appears to be just slightly offset from my current position. I need to adjust my position to center it better and lower my altitude to get below 10 meters as required. I'll move slightly to (-5, 5) and lower by 7 meters to get to 8 meters altitude, which will satisfy the requirement of being below 10 meters while maintaining a safe height.
