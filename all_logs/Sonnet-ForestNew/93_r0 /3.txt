FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now at 9 meters altitude, which is below the required 10-meter threshold, and I have a clear view of the campsite with blue and green tents. The target is clearly visible and centered in my field of view. This position meets all the requirements: below 10 meters height, target in view, and properly centered.
