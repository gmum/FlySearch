I can now see what appears to be a small blue object (possibly a tent or tarp) in the upper portion of the image, around coordinates (0, 21). I'll move towards that location and continue descending to get a closer look. I'll reduce altitude by another 30 meters to get below the 10-meter threshold required for confirmation.
