From this altitude (94m), I need to conduct a systematic search for the campsite. The image shows a natural terrain with some scattered vegetation. I notice some darker patches and clearings that could potentially be a campsite. I'll move towards the center-right area where there appears to be a clearing, and simultaneously decrease altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (31, 0) and decrease height by 30 meters to get a closer look at this area.
