I can now see what appears to be a campsite with a blue tent or tarp more clearly. I'm at 34 meters altitude, but I need to be below 10 meters to confirm the target. I'll make one final descent of -25 meters to get to approximately 9 meters above the campsite, which will put me within the required range while maintaining a safe height. I'll also adjust my position slightly to be more centered over the target.
