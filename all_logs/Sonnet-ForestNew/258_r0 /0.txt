<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an aircraft or helicopter on the ground near coordinates (-21, -11). This seems to be the anomaly we're looking for as it's clearly not a natural part of this forested/grassy environment. I need to move closer to it and reduce altitude to get below 10 meters above it. I'll move directly to those coordinates and descend by 25 meters to get close to but not too close to the ground.</Reasoning>
