<Reasoning>I am now directly above the aircraft, which is clearly visible in the image, and at 7 meters altitude. This is within the required 10 meters or less above the object, and I have a clear view of it in my field of vision. Since I've met all the criteria - being centered on the object, being below 10 meters altitude, and having it in my field of view - I can confirm the find.</Reasoning>
