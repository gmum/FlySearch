At 40 meters altitude, I can now see more detail in the area. I notice some interesting areas in the clearings. I'll continue my search by moving slightly northeast and descending further to get an even closer look at potential areas of interest. I'll move to (13, 13) and descend another 20 meters to improve visibility while maintaining enough height to continue searching if needed.
