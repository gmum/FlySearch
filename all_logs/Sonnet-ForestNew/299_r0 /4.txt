<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly positioned above what appears to be a gray stone or artificial object that stands out from the natural environment. I am at 6 meters altitude, which is well below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view and centered in the frame. This matches all the criteria for identifying the anomaly.
