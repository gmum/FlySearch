From this initial view at 67 meters altitude, I can see a grassland area with some scattered trees. I need to conduct a systematic search to find any anomalies. Given that I need to be below 10 meters when I find the object, I'll first move forward and reduce altitude to get a better view of the northern section. I'll move to coordinates (0, 22) and drop down to 40 meters to start my search pattern.
