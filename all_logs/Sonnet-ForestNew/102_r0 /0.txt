<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a forest fire with orange flames and smoke in the image, slightly north of the center coordinates (0,0). I need to position myself directly above it and get closer to confirm. I'll move to coordinates (0, 17) where the fire appears to be centered, and descend to about 8 meters above it to meet the requirement of being below 10 meters.</Reasoning>
