<Reasoning>I apologize for my previous aggressive descent. Now I can see I'm very close to the aircraft and need to be more careful. I should maintain a safer distance while still staying under 10 meters relative to the aircraft. I'll move slightly up and to the side to get a better view while maintaining a safe distance.</Reasoning>
