<Reasoning>I need to be more cautious. Given that we're dealing with an aircraft, I should maintain a safer distance to avoid any risks. I'll move to a position that gives me a clear view while staying at a safe distance. I'll move to (8, 8) which will give me a diagonal view of the aircraft while keeping me at my current altitude.</Reasoning>
