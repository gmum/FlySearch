<Reasoning>I can see an airplane on the ground which appears to be the anomaly in this natural environment. It's directly below the drone's current position at coordinates (0, 0). I need to descend to get closer to it while maintaining my position above it. I'll descend by 85 meters to get to 9 meters above the aircraft, which will put me well within the required 10-meter height requirement while keeping the object centered in my field of view.</Reasoning>
