I can see what appears to be a trash pile or debris area near the coordinates (-20, -20), appearing as a brownish/orange patch on the ground. Since I need to get closer to confirm and need to be below 10 meters above the object, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly decrease altitude to about 8 meters to ensure I'm within the required range.
