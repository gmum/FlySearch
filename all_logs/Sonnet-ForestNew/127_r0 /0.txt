<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small forest fire with reddish flames near coordinates (0, 55) in the northern part of the image. Since I need to get closer and lower to confirm this and need to be below 10 meters from the fire to complete the objective, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude to get a better view.</Reasoning>
