FOUND

<Reasoning>I am now at 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and I can see the forest fire in my field of view. The red glow of the fire is visible through the foliage. My position is correctly centered on the target and I'm at an appropriate height to confirm the find.</Reasoning>
