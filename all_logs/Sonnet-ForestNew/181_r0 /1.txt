<Reasoning>I'm now at 7 meters altitude, which is perfect (below 10m) to confirm my target. I can clearly see a pile of debris/trash with what appears to be some storage tanks or containers near coordinate (2, 2). Since I'm at the right altitude and the target is in my field of view, I can declare that I've found it.</Reasoning>
