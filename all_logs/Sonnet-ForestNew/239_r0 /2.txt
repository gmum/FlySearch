I need to reconsider my approach. I'm viewing the aircraft, which is clearly the anomaly, but I've been warned twice about getting too close. Since I'm currently at 12 meters and can clearly see the aircraft, and considering the safety warnings, I should stay at this position. While it's slightly above the 10-meter requirement, trying to get lower might be dangerous given the previous warnings. The aircraft is clearly in my field of view and I'm centered on it.
