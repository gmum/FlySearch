I'm currently very close to the aircraft, which I can see is the anomaly in this natural environment. I'm at 12 meters altitude, which is still a bit too high to meet the requirement of being below 10 meters. I'll make a small downward adjustment to get to approximately 9 meters while maintaining my current horizontal position.
