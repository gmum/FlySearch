<Reasoning>I need to start searching for the campsite systematically. From this altitude of 76 meters, I can see a large area but need to get lower to spot details better. I notice some darker patches and vegetation clusters that could potentially hide a campsite. I'll start by moving to the center area (0, 0) and descending to get a better view of the terrain.</Reasoning>
