<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the trash pile in the lower portion of the image. I need to center myself directly above it for a proper view. The pile appears to be around coordinates (0, -5). Since I'm already at a good altitude of 7 meters, which is below the required 10 meters, I'll just move to center over the trash pile.</Reasoning>
