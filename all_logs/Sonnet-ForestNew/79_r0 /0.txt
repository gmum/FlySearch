<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be some light-colored objects or debris near the center of the image that could be the trash pile. To get a better look and ensure I'm within the required altitude limit, I'll move closer to that area and reduce altitude to about 8 meters. This will put me below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining visual contact with the potential target.</Reasoning>
