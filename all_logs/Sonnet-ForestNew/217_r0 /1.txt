<Reasoning>I'm currently very close to the aircraft at 12 meters altitude. I need to make a smaller, more careful movement to get just below 10 meters while staying centered over the aircraft. I'll descend 3 meters to get to 9 meters altitude, which will put me at a safe height to declare the object found.</Reasoning>
