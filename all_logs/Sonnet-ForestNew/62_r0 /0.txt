I can see what appears to be a small building or structure near coordinates (0, -30). I should move closer to that location and reduce altitude to get a better view and confirm if this is the target building. I'll move directly to those coordinates and descend by 50 meters to get a clearer view while still maintaining enough height to safely assess the situation.
