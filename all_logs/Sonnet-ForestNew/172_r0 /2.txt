Now I can clearly see what appears to be a campsite area with some stones and cleared ground around (0, 0). I'm already at a good altitude of 8 meters, which is below the required 10 meters, and I'm close enough to the target. The campsite is clearly visible in my field of view, so I can confirm the finding.
