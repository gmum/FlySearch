<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a forest fire with smoke and orange glow around coordinates (-31, -31). I need to move to that location and decrease my altitude significantly to get closer to the fire, but not too close for safety. I'll aim to get about 9 meters above it for optimal observation while staying under the 10-meter requirement.</Reasoning>
