<Reasoning>I can clearly see the forest fire on the western side of my current position. I need to move slightly to the left to center it in my field of view. I'm already at a good altitude (9 meters) which is below the required 10 meters, so I'll maintain this height while moving to center the fire in my view.</Reasoning>
