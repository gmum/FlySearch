<Reasoning>I can see a yellow patch in the southwestern quadrant of the image that seems out of place compared to the surrounding green vegetation. This could be our anomaly. I'll move towards that area and reduce altitude to get a better look. I'll aim for coordinates near (-27, -53) and descend by 50 meters to get closer.</Reasoning>
