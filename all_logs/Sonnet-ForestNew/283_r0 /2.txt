<Reasoning>I can now see two yellow patches in the image, one at approximately (3, -5) and another near (3, 0). Since I'm already at a good altitude of 8 meters, which is below our 10-meter requirement, and I can see the anomaly in my field of view, I should center on one of these patches. I'll move to the closer yellow patch at (3, 0) while maintaining my current altitude.</Reasoning>
