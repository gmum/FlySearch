I can see what appears to be a blue object that could be related to a campsite near the center of the image. I'll move closer to that location and reduce altitude to get a better view. Since the object appears to be slightly off-center, I'll adjust my position to (13, -13) and decrease altitude by 29 meters to get below 10 meters height.
