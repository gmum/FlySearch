<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small campsite with dark-colored tents or structures near the center of the image. To get a better view and meet the requirement of being below 10 meters above the object, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude. Given their position, I'll aim for coordinates (0, -23) and descend to get closer.</Reasoning>
