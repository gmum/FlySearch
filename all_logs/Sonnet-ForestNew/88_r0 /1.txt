From this lower altitude of 26 meters, I can see more detail but still no clear sign of the person. I'll continue the search by moving to the upper right quadrant (9, 9) and lower the altitude further to about 15 meters to get an even closer look. This systematic approach will help cover the area thoroughly while getting closer to the required altitude of under 10 meters.
