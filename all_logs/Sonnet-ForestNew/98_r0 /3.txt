<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly positioned above the trash pile at 9 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters. The trash pile is clearly visible and centered in my field of view. The mission requirements have been met: the object is in view, I am centered over it, and I am below 10 meters altitude.
