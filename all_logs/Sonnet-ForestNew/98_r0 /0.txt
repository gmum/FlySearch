I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. From this altitude of 94 meters, it's difficult to spot small details on the ground. I notice some variations in the terrain, but need to get lower to better identify potential objects. I'll move to a central position and reduce altitude significantly to get a better view of the area.

I'll move to coordinate (0, 0) which is the center of the grid, and descend by 50 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue searching if needed.
