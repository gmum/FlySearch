I can now clearly see the trash pile in the image near coordinates (0, 5). The pile is clearly visible and I'm at a good altitude of 14 meters. Since I need to be centered on the object and below 10 meters, I'll move to those coordinates and descend slightly to ensure I'm below 10 meters while keeping the trash pile in view.
