<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a forest fire with smoke in the center of the image. Since my objective is to get below 10 meters above the fire and center on it, I'll move to coordinates (0, 29) where the fire appears to be centered, and descend significantly to get closer to the required altitude.</Reasoning>
