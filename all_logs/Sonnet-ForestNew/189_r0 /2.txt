I can see what appears to be a trash pile near coordinates (0, -6). From my current position and altitude of 18 meters, I need to move slightly to center on it and descend a bit more to get below 10 meters as required by the objective. I'll move to those coordinates and descend by 10 meters, which will put me at 8 meters above the ground - well within the required range of being below 10 meters.
