I need to start a systematic search for the trash pile. From my current altitude of 90 meters, the view is quite broad but details are hard to make out. I'll start by moving to the center of the grid (0, 0) and descending to get a better view of the area. This will give me a good vantage point to start my search while maintaining visibility of the surrounding area. I'll descend by 40 meters to get a clearer view while still maintaining enough height to survey the area effectively.
