I can now clearly see the trash pile in my field of view, and I'm centered on it at coordinates (0, -2). I'm currently at 7 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters. The object is clearly visible and I'm properly centered on it. All conditions are met: the object is in view, I'm centered on it, and I'm below 10 meters altitude.
