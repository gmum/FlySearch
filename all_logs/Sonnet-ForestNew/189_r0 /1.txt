From this lower altitude, I can see more details but still no clear sign of the trash pile. I notice some areas that look slightly different in the lower right quadrant of the image. I'll move towards (16, -16) and continue descending to get an even closer look. I'll decrease altitude by another 30 meters to get a much clearer view of the ground features.
