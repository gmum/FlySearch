FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly centered on the purple object that stands out from the natural environment. I am at 6 meters altitude, which is well below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly visible in my field of view. This position meets all the requirements for declaring the anomaly as found.
