I need to perform a systematic search of the area to find any anomalies. From this height, I can see a decent portion of the area, but I should get lower to have a better view. I notice that the area is mostly covered in trees and grass, so any non-natural object should stand out. I'll start by moving to the center position and lowering the altitude to get a better view of the surroundings.
