<Reasoning>
I need to move back slightly towards the center and get a bit lower to be under 10 meters above the anomaly. I can see some vegetation details very clearly now, but I need to reposition to get a better view of the area where I saw the brownish patch. I'll move to (0, 0) and descend slightly more.
