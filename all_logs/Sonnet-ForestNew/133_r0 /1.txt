I can see what appears to be the inside or surface of a building, likely a wooden wall or floor. Since I'm already at 7 meters altitude, which is within our target range of below 10 meters, and I can clearly see the structure, I'll maintain this position as it meets all requirements - being below 10 meters and having the target in view.
