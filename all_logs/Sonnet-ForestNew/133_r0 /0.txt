I can see a building directly below the drone at coordinates (0, 0). Since it's clearly visible and I need to get closer to it while maintaining it in my field of view, I'll descend by 52 meters to get to approximately 8 meters above it. This will put me well within the required 10-meter height requirement while keeping the building centered in my view.
