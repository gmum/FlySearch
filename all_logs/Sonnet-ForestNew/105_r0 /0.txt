<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a building or structure near the center of the image. To get a better view and get below 10 meters as required, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude. I'll position myself directly above it at coordinates (0, 0) and descend to about 8 meters above it, which should give me a clear view while meeting the altitude requirement.</Reasoning>
