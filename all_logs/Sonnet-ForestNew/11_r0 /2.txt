<Reasoning>I apologize for the unsafe maneuver. I can see I'm very close to the building now. I need to back up a bit to maintain a safe distance while keeping the building in view. I'll move slightly to the left to (0, 0) while maintaining the current altitude to get a better centered view of the building while staying at a safe distance.</Reasoning>
