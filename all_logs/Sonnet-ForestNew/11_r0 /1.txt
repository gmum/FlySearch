<Reasoning>I can now see the building clearly in the right side of the image. I need to center myself over it and get a bit lower to be under 10 meters. I'll move to coordinates (10, 0) and descend to 8 meters to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining visual contact with the building.</Reasoning>
