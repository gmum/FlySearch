<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small building or structure in the upper left quadrant of the image, around coordinates (-53, 27). Since I need to get closer to confirm and need to be below 10 meters to complete the objective, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude to about 15 meters to get a better view.</Reasoning>
