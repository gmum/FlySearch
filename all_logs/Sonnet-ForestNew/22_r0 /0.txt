I need to start searching for the trash pile systematically. From this altitude (70m), it's difficult to spot small details clearly. I notice some variations in the terrain, but I need to get lower to better identify potential targets. I'll move to a central position and decrease altitude significantly to get a better view of the area.

I'll move towards coordinates (0, 0) which is the center of the grid, and simultaneously decrease altitude by 40 meters to get a better view while maintaining enough height to continue searching if needed.
