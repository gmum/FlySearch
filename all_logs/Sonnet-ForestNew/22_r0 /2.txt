At this altitude (13m), I'm quite close to the vegetation, but I still need to continue my search. I can see mostly leaves and foliage in this area, but no trash pile. I'll move slightly east and south where there seems to be a bit more open space between the vegetation, and maintain this altitude to get a good view of that area.
