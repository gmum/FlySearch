FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly positioned at 7 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and I am centered over what appears to be a collection of debris/trash (dark objects scattered on the ground). The trash pile is clearly visible in my field of view and I am centered on it at coordinates (0,0).
