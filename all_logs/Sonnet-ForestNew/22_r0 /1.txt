From this lower altitude (29m), I can see more details but I still don't clearly spot the trash pile. I notice some variations in the terrain and coloring in the southeast quadrant of the visible area. I'll move towards that direction (10, -10) and lower the altitude a bit more to get an even better view of that area.
