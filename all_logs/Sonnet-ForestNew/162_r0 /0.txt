From this initial altitude of 63 meters, I can see a general overview of the area but need to search more carefully for the trash pile. I notice some variations in the terrain, but to effectively spot a trash pile, I should first move to a lower altitude while staying roughly in the center area. This will give me a better view of the details while maintaining a good vantage point for further searching if needed.
