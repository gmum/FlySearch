<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small blue object in the eastern part of the image, around coordinates (62, 0). Since the objective is to find an anomaly in the environment, this blue object could be what we're looking for. I'll move closer to that location and decrease altitude to get a better look.</Reasoning>
