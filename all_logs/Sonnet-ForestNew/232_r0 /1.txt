<Reasoning>I can now clearly see a blue circular object, which appears to be a small pool or water feature, around coordinates (-35, 0). This is definitely the anomaly we're looking for in this natural environment. I need to get closer and lower to be within 10 meters of it. I'll move directly above it and decrease altitude significantly.</Reasoning>
