I can see what appears to be a long cylindrical object (possibly a pipe or container) near coordinates (26, -26). This seems out of place in the natural environment and is likely the anomaly I'm looking for. I'll move closer to that location and reduce altitude significantly to get a better look and position myself above it at the required height.
