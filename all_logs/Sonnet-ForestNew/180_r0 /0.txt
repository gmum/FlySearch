<Reasoning>I can see a building with what appears to be a metal/tin roof in the center of the image. Since I'm currently at 32 meters altitude and need to get below 10 meters while staying centered on the building, I'll move to the center coordinates (0,0) and descend to 8 meters. This will put me in a good position directly above the building at an acceptable height.</Reasoning>
