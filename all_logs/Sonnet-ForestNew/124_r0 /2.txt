At 16 meters altitude, I can now see what appears to be the trash pile near coordinates (0, -5). I'll move directly over it and descend slightly more to get within the required 10 meters while keeping it centered in my field of view. Since I'm already fairly close and can clearly see the target, a small adjustment should be sufficient.
