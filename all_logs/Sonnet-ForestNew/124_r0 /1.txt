From this lower altitude of 47 meters, I can see more details of the terrain. I notice what appears to be some disturbed area or potential trash near coordinates (-16, -16). I'll move to that location and descend further to get a closer look. Getting lower will help me confirm if this is indeed the trash pile we're looking for.
