I need to perform a systematic search for the trash pile. From my current altitude of 78 meters, the view is quite broad but it's hard to spot small details. I notice some variations in the terrain with patches of different vegetation and possibly some disturbed areas. I'll start by moving to position (0, 26) and descending to get a better view of the central-northern area of the search zone. This will allow me to scan the area more carefully while maintaining a good vantage point.
