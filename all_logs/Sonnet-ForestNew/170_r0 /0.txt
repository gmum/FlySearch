From this aerial view at 75 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search for the building. I notice that the terrain is mostly covered in vegetation with some clearings. Since buildings are typically easier to spot in clearings, I'll start by moving to a central position and decreasing altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinate (0, 0) which is in the center of the visible area and reduce altitude by 30 meters to get a clearer view of potential structures.
