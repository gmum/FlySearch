At 23 meters altitude, I can now see more clearly through the vegetation. I notice what appears to be some kind of structure or clearing near (-8, 0). I'll move to that position and descend further to get a better look at what might be our target building. The lower altitude will help confirm if this is indeed the building we're looking for.
