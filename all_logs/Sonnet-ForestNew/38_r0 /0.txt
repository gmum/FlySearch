<Reasoning>I can see a building with what appears to be a metal or solar panel roof in the northwestern quadrant of the image, around coordinates (-33, 0). Since I need to get closer to properly identify it and need to be below 10 meters when I confirm the target, I'll move towards that location while also decreasing altitude significantly.</Reasoning>
