<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be part of the building with metal/solar panel roof at the eastern edge of my view, around coordinates (5, 0). I need to move closer to center it in my field of view. Since I'm already at a good altitude (8 meters, which is below 10 meters as required), I'll maintain this height while moving towards the building.</Reasoning>
