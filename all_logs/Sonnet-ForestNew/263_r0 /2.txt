<Reasoning>I am now correctly positioned at a 7-meter altitude (which is below the required 10 meters) and I can see the aircraft clearly in my field of view. The aircraft is centered in my view at my current position. All conditions are met: I am below 10 meters, the object is in view, and I am centered over it.</Reasoning>
