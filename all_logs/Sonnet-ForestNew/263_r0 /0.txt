<Reasoning>I can see an aircraft on the ground which appears to be the anomalous object in this natural environment. It's positioned slightly to the right of the center of the image. To get a better view and ensure I'm within 10 meters of it, I'll move closer to its position and significantly reduce altitude. I'll aim for coordinates near (22, 0) and reduce height by 60 meters to get below 10 meters relative to the object.</Reasoning>
