<Reasoning>Now I'm at a good altitude (7 meters) which is below 10 meters as required, and I can clearly see the aircraft. However, I need to center myself better over the aircraft to ensure it's properly in my field of view before declaring FOUND. I'll move slightly to coordinate (0, 0) while maintaining my current altitude.</Reasoning>
