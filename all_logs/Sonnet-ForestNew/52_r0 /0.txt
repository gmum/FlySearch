<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a reddish area around coordinates (-25, -25) that could potentially be a forest fire. I'll move closer to that location and reduce altitude to get a better view. I'll aim to get to about 20 meters altitude to confirm if this is indeed the fire while positioning myself directly above it.</Reasoning>
