I can now clearly see the green tent/campsite structure. I'm currently positioned at 9 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters. The campsite is directly in my field of view, and I'm properly centered on it. All conditions are met: the object is in view, I'm below 10 meters altitude, and I'm centered on the target.
