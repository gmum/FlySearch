I can now see what appears to be a green tent or campsite structure near coordinates (0, -12). I'll move to that location and descend slightly to get within 10 meters of it while keeping it in my field of view. Since I'm currently at 18 meters, I'll descend by 9 meters to get to 9 meters altitude, which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters.
