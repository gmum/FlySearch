<Reasoning>From this initial view at 32 meters altitude, I can see the terrain is mostly green with trees and grass. I'll start by moving to (11, 11) and descending slightly to get a better view of that area, as it appears to have some cleared space that might make it easier to spot anomalies. This will help me begin a systematic search pattern while getting closer to the ground.</Reasoning>
