<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a circular gray object or anomaly in the lower left portion of the image, near coordinates (-33, -33). Since I need to get closer to confirm and need to be below 10 meters to properly identify it, I'll move to that position and significantly reduce altitude to about 8 meters to ensure I'm within the required range while keeping the object in view.</Reasoning>
