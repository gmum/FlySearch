<Reasoning>From this lower altitude and closer position, I can now confirm that there appears to be a gray circular object that stands out from the natural environment. I'm at 8 meters altitude which is within the required range (below 10 meters), and the object is clearly in my field of view. This meets all the criteria for completing the task.</Reasoning>
