I can now clearly see what appears to be a damaged or abandoned vehicle in the middle of the grassy area. This is definitely the anomaly we were looking for. I am already at 7 meters altitude which is below our required 10-meter threshold, and the object is centered in my field of view. This meets all our criteria: below 10m altitude, object in view, and centered on the target.
