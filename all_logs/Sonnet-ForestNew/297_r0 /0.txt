I can see a dark shadow or object near coordinates (0,10). It appears to be something that doesn't match the natural environment of grass and scattered vegetation. I'll move to that position and lower my altitude to get a better look at what might be our anomaly. I'll descend to 8 meters to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining visual contact.
