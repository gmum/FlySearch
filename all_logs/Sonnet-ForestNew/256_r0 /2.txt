At this lower altitude of 10 meters, I can now see what appears to be a blue-colored object near coordinates (0, 3). This seems to be the anomaly we're looking for as it stands out against the natural green forest background. I'll move directly to those coordinates while maintaining this low altitude to get centered over it.</Reasoning>
