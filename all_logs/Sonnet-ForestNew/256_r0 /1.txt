<Reasoning>
From this lower altitude of 26 meters, I can see more detail, and I notice what appears to be some paths or clearings running diagonally through the area. I can also see what might be something unusual near coordinates (-9, -9). I'll move to that location and lower my altitude further to get a better look at what might be an anomaly in that area.</Reasoning>
