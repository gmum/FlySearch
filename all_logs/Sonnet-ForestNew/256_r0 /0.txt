<Reasoning>
From this aerial view at 46 meters, I can see a forested area with what appears to be some paths or clearings. I should conduct a systematic search starting by moving to a central position and lowering my altitude to get a better view of any potential anomalies. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) which is the center of the grid and decrease altitude by 20 meters to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
