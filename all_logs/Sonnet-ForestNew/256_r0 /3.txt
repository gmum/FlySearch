<Reasoning>
I am now directly above what appears to be a blue artificial object in the forest, which is clearly the anomaly we're looking for. I am at 10 meters altitude, which meets the requirement of being below 10 meters or at 10 meters exactly. The object is centered in my field of view, so I can now confirm the finding.</Reasoning>
