<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a blue circular object or pool in the center of the image at coordinates (0, 0). This seems to be the anomaly we're looking for as it's clearly different from the natural environment of trees and grass. Since I need to get below 10 meters to confirm this target and I'm currently at 42 meters, I'll move to the same coordinates but descend by 35 meters, which will put me at 7 meters above the object - well within our required range. I'll keep the x and y coordinates the same to stay centered on the object.</Reasoning>
