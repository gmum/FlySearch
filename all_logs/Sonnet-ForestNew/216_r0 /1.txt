<Reasoning>Perfect! I'm now at 7 meters altitude directly above what appears to be a large circular water feature with an interesting nested circular design. This is definitely the anomalous object we were looking for, as it's clearly artificial and stands out from the natural surroundings. I'm already in the optimal position - below 10 meters and centered on the object with a clear view.</Reasoning>
