From this lower altitude, I can see the terrain better but I still don't spot the trash pile clearly. I notice some areas that look different from the natural vegetation. I'll move towards (-11, -11) and continue descending to get an even closer look at the southern area, as it appears to have some interesting features that could be what we're looking for.
