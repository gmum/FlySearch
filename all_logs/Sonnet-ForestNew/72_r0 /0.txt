<Reasoning>I can clearly see a forest fire with orange flames and smoke in the center of the image around coordinates (0, 0). Since I need to get closer and below 10 meters to properly identify it, I will move to those coordinates and significantly reduce my altitude to about 8 meters to ensure I'm within the required range while maintaining a safe distance from the fire.</Reasoning>
