<Reasoning>I am already at the correct position and altitude (8 meters) directly above the forest fire. The image shows I'm centered on the intense fire with clear visibility of the flames. No further movement is needed as I'm already meeting all the requirements: below 10 meters altitude, centered on the target, and have clear visual confirmation.</Reasoning>
