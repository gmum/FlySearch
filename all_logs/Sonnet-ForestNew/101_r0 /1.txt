<Reasoning>I can see I'm at a good altitude now (9 meters, which is below 10 meters as required), but I'm too close to some foliage and need to adjust my position. I can see something that might be the trash pile just a bit to the north and east. I'll make a small adjustment to center on it while maintaining this good altitude.</Reasoning>
