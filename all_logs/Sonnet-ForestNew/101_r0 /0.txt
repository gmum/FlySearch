<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small trash pile near coordinates (18, 18). It looks like a light-colored spot on the ground that's different from the natural terrain. I'll move towards that location and decrease my altitude significantly to get a better look and get below 10 meters as required.</Reasoning>
