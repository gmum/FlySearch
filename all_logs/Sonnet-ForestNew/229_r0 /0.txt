<Reasoning>I need to conduct a systematic search of the area to find any anomalies. From this height, I can see a large area but might miss smaller details. I'll start by moving to a lower altitude while staying near the center of the grid to get a better view of the surroundings. I'll reduce altitude by 40 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining good coverage of the search area.</Reasoning>
