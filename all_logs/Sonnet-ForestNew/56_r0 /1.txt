I can now see what appears to be a trash pile more clearly in the lower right portion of the image, near coordinates (18, -18). I'll move to that location and descend further to get within 10 meters of the target. I'll reduce altitude by 20 meters which should put me at approximately 7 meters above the ground, well within the required 10-meter threshold.
