<Reasoning>I can now clearly see what appears to be a metallic or reflective circular structure, which is definitely the anomaly we're looking for. I'm already at a good altitude (9 meters), and the object is in my field of view. This is definitely not a natural formation and stands out from the surrounding environment. Since I'm at the right height (below 10 meters) and have a clear view of the anomaly, I can confirm the find.</Reasoning>
