<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a small blue circular pond or pool in the middle of the grassy area. This seems like it could be the anomaly we're looking for, as it's the only artificial-looking structure visible in this natural environment. I'll move to the center coordinates where the pool is located and decrease altitude to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
