From this lower altitude of 9 meters, I can now clearly see what appears to be a light-colored circular or spherical object in my field of view. I am already at an appropriate altitude (below 10 meters) and the object is centered in my view at coordinate (0,0). This matches the criteria for reporting a found object - it's in view, I'm centered on it, and I'm below 10 meters altitude.
