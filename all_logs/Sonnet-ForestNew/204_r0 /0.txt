I can see what appears to be a light-colored circular object near the center of the image. To get a better look and confirm if this is the anomaly we're searching for, I'll move directly above it and decrease altitude significantly to get closer to the 10-meter requirement. The object appears to be near coordinate (0, 0), which is convenient since it's in the center of our grid.
