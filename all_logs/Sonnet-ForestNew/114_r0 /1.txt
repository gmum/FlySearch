From this lower altitude (44m), I can see more details of the terrain. I notice some interesting areas, particularly near the coordinates (-15, 29) where there appears to be a clearing with some different coloration that might be worth investigating. I'll move to that location and lower my altitude further to get a better look at what might be our target campsite.
