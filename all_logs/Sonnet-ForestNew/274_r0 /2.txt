<Reasoning>Now I have a better overview of the area. The aircraft is clearly the anomaly in this natural environment. I need to position myself at a safe distance but still below 10 meters relative to the object. Given that the aircraft is a large object on the ground, I'll move to a position near it at (-17, -17) and descend to about 9 meters above ground level, which should put me at a safe distance while still being below 10 meters relative to the target.</Reasoning>
