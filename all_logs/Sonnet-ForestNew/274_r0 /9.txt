<Reasoning>Now I have a clear view of the aircraft again. I need to position myself at a safe distance while being below 10 meters relative to it. I'll move to (-17, 17), which puts me at a diagonal to the aircraft's nose, and descend to 9 meters. This position should give me a clear view while maintaining a safe distance.</Reasoning>
