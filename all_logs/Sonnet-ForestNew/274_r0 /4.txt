<Reasoning>I still don't see the aircraft from this position. Since I need to get back to where the aircraft was, and I know it was north of my current position, I'll move towards (0, 6) which is at the top of my current visible range. This should help me get closer to where the aircraft was while maintaining safe operations within visible bounds.</Reasoning>
