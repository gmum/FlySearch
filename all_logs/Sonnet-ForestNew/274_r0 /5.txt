<Reasoning>I'm still not seeing the aircraft. Since I know it was further north, and I'm currently too low to get a good overview of the area, I should increase my altitude temporarily to get a better view of the surrounding area. I'll maintain my current position but ascend to 50 meters to get a better view of where I need to go next.</Reasoning>
