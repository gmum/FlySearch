<Reasoning>I see we're now under the wing of the aircraft, which is not a safe position. I need to move to a position where I can see the entire aircraft while maintaining a safe distance. I'll move to (-6, -6) to get away from being under the aircraft while staying at my current altitude.</Reasoning>
