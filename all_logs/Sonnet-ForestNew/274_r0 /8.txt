<Reasoning>We've ended up in some vegetation and lost sight of the aircraft again. Since we know the aircraft is the anomaly and we need a clear view of it, I'll first gain some altitude to get our bearings, moving up to 50 meters while staying in the same position. This should help us see over the vegetation and locate the aircraft again.</Reasoning>
