<Reasoning>Now I can see the aircraft again! Since I need to be below 10 meters relative to it but also maintain a safe distance, I'll position myself at (0, 17) which is near the aircraft but not dangerously close, and descend to 9 meters. This should put me at a good observation point while meeting the requirement of being below 10 meters relative to the target.</Reasoning>
