<Reasoning>I can see a commercial aircraft on the ground which appears to be the anomaly in this natural environment. Since I need to get closer to properly inspect it and need to be below 10 meters relative to it, I'll move to position (16, 0) which is near the center of the aircraft and descend by 40 meters. This should put me at about 7 meters above the aircraft, which meets the requirement of being below 10 meters.</Reasoning>
