<Reasoning>I apologize for the unsafe maneuver. I see that we're now very close to the aircraft at 10 meters altitude. Since this appears to be the anomaly we're looking for but we're too close to it for safety, I should move back and up to get a better view of the surrounding area and continue the search in a safer manner.</Reasoning>
