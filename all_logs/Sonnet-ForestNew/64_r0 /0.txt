From this aerial view at 81 meters, I can see a forested area with some clearings. Since I'm looking for a campsite, I should first move to a lower altitude to get a better view of potential clearings where a campsite might be located. I notice some lighter patches that could be clearings near the center of the image. I'll descend to about 40 meters while staying in the central area to get a better view.
