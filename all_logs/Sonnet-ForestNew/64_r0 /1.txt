At 40 meters, I can now see the terrain more clearly. There appears to be a clearing in the central-northern area around coordinates (0, 13). I can see what might be a campsite in that clearing. I'll move to that position and descend further to get a closer look and verify if it's indeed the campsite we're looking for.
