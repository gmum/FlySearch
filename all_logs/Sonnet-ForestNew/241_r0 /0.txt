From this altitude of 74 meters, I can see a general overview of the area. I notice what appears to be a slightly darker or denser patch of vegetation near the center of the image around coordinates (0, 25). This could potentially be where our anomaly is located. I'll move to that position and decrease altitude significantly to get a better look at what might be there.
