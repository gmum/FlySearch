FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now 8 meters above what appears to be a circular water feature with a distinct dark ring or pattern within it. This is clearly the anomalous object we were looking for - a manufactured or artificial pond with some kind of circular structure. I am well within the 10-meter requirement, centered on the object, and have a clear view of it.
