From this initial altitude of 42 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. Since I need to find a person and get below 10 meters of their position, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while moving towards the center of the grid where there's more open space. I'll move to (0, 0) and simultaneously descend to about 20 meters to get a clearer view of the ground while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively.
