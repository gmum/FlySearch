I can see what appears to be a figure on the ground just below my current position. Since I need to get below 10 meters to properly confirm and mark the target as found, I'll descend to 8 meters while maintaining my current position over the target. This will put me well within the required 10-meter threshold while keeping the target in my field of view.
