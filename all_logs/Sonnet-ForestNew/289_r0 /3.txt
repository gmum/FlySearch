I can now clearly see the circular dark object that appears to be the anomaly we're looking for. I'm currently at 8 meters altitude which is within our target range of being below 10 meters, and the object is directly in my field of view. This position meets all the requirements: the object is visible, I'm centered on it, and I'm below 10 meters altitude.
