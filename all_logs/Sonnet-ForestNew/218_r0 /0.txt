<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a linear object (possibly a fallen pole or similar) near the center of the image. To get a better look and confirm if this is the anomaly, I should move closer and lower my altitude. I'll position myself directly above the center point where I spotted this object and significantly reduce altitude to get within the required 10 meters.</Reasoning>
