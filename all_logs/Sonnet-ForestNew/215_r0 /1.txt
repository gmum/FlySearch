<Reasoning>I can now clearly see what appears to be the aircraft on the ground. I am already at a good altitude (8 meters), which is below the required 10 meters, and I am well-centered on the object. This is definitely an anomaly - an aircraft in what appears to be a natural environment. Since I am properly positioned and at the correct altitude with the object in view, I can confirm the find.</Reasoning>
