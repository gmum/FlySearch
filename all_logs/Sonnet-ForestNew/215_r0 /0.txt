<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a commercial aircraft in the image, which is not a typical object you'd expect to find in a natural environment. I should move closer to inspect it and get below 10 meters relative to it to confirm this is the anomaly we're looking for. Since the aircraft appears to be centered around (0, 27), I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude to get closer to it.</Reasoning>
