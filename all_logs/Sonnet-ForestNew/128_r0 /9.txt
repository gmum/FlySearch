<Reasoning>
We've reached the maximum number of allowed moves (9) and this final position shows more vegetation but no sign of our target person. The search was unsuccessful within the given move limit. We maintained a good search altitude below 10 meters for most of the search, but we weren't able to locate the target person in the areas we checked.
