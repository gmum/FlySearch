<Reasoning>From this altitude, I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. I notice some variations in the terrain, but I need to get lower to better identify any potential trash piles. I'll move to the center of the grid (0,0) and decrease altitude by 20 meters to get a better view of the area.</Reasoning>
