<Reasoning>I can now see what appears to be a darker patch or potential trash pile near coordinates (0, -17). I'll move to that location and decrease altitude further to get a closer look and verify if this is the target. I'll drop another 15 meters to get below the 10-meter requirement.</Reasoning>
