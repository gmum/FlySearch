I can see an airplane in the image which appears to be an anomaly in this natural environment. Since I'm currently at 47 meters altitude and need to get below 10 meters to properly identify and confirm this as the target object, I'll move towards the aircraft's position (roughly at 16, 0) and decrease my altitude significantly to get closer to it. I'll aim to get to about 8 meters above it for a clear view while staying under the 10-meter requirement.
