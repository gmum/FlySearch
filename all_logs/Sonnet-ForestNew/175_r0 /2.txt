I'm now at a good low altitude of 13 meters, and the grid has scaled down further (-9 to 9). I can see more ground detail, but still no sign of the person. I'll move to the northeast quadrant (4, 4) while maintaining this altitude to continue the systematic search. The northeast area appears to have some clearer patches which might make spotting a person easier.
