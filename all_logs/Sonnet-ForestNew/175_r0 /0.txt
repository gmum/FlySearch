I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. From my current altitude of 60 meters, I can see a good portion of the terrain, but it might be too high to spot a person clearly. I'll start by moving to the center of the grid (0, 0) and descending to get a better view. I'll reduce the altitude by 30 meters to get to 30 meters height, which will give me a clearer view while still maintaining a decent search area.
