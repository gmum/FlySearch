From this lower altitude, I can see more detail but still no clear sign of the person. I notice that my grid coordinates have changed to a smaller scale (-19 to 19). I'll move towards the southwest quadrant (-10, -10) and continue descending to get an even closer look, reducing altitude by another 15 meters to get to about 14 meters height.
