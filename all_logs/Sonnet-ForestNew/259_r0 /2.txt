At this lower altitude of 9 meters, I can now see a yellow object or marking near coordinates (-3, 3). This appears to be the anomaly we're looking for as it stands out against the natural green and brown colors of the environment. I'm currently at a good altitude (below 10 meters) and the object is in my field of view, so I'll move to center directly over it.
