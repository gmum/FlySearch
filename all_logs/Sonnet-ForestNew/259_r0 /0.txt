From this aerial view at 47 meters, I can see a forested area with some clearings. To effectively search for any anomalies, I should first move to a more central position and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll move towards coordinate (0, 0) which is in the center of the visible area and reduce altitude by 20 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue the search if needed.
