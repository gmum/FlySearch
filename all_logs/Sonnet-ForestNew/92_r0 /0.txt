From this height and initial position, I need to conduct a systematic search. I notice the terrain is mixed with trees and open areas. I should first descend to get a better view while moving slightly to investigate the area around (25, 25) which has some interesting features. A lower altitude will give me a better chance of spotting the person while maintaining a good field of view.
