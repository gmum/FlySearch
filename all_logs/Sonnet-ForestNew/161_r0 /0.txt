From this initial altitude of 49 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search. I can see a fairly open area with some vegetation patches. To get a better view while still maintaining good coverage, I'll first move to a more central position at (0, 0) and reduce altitude to 30 meters. This will give me a clearer view while still maintaining a decent search area.
