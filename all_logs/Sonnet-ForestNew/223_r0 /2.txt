<Reasoning>From this higher and wider view, I can see we need to search the surrounding area more systematically. The airplane is clearly visible but may not be our target anomaly since it's a known object in the scene. I should explore the southeastern quadrant to look for any unusual objects. I'll maintain a safer altitude while moving to that area.</Reasoning>
