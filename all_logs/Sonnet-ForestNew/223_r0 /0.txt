<Reasoning>I see an airplane in the center of the image which appears to be the anomalous object in this natural environment. Since I'm currently at 81 meters and need to get below 10 meters relative to the object to consider it "found", I'll move down significantly while staying centered on the object. I'll descend by 75 meters to get to approximately 6 meters above the object.</Reasoning>
