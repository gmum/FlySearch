<Reasoning>I apologize for my previous aggressive descent. Now I can see we're very close to the airplane and need to be more careful. I'm currently at 12 meters above ground level, which means I need to move away to safely continue the search. I'll increase altitude and move to the side to get a better view of the surrounding area.</Reasoning>
