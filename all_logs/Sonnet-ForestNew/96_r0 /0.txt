<Reasoning>I need to systematically search the area for the campsite. From this altitude of 66 meters, I can see a good portion of the terrain, but I need to get lower to better identify potential objects. I notice some darker patches that could be clusters of trees or potential camping areas. I'll start by moving towards the center-left portion of the grid at (-22, 0) and simultaneously decrease altitude by 30 meters to get a better view.</Reasoning>
