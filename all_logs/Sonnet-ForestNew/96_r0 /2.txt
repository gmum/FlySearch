<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a tent or campsite structure under the tree canopy. I am currently at 9 meters altitude which is within the required range (below 10 meters), and the target is clearly in my field of view and centered. Since I meet all the requirements - being centered on the target, having it in view, and being below 10 meters altitude - I can confirm the find.</Reasoning>
