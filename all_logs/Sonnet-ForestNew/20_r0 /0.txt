I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. The image shows a grassy terrain with some vegetation patches. From my current altitude of 43 meters, I can cover a decent area but might miss smaller details. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) and descend by 20 meters to get closer to the ground while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively.
