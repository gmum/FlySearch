From this lower altitude, I can see the terrain more clearly. I notice something unusual in the northern section of the image - there appears to be what might be a light-colored structure or object near the coordinates (0, 37). I'll move in that direction and lower my altitude further to get a better look at what appears to be different from the natural vegetation.
