I can now clearly see what appears to be a white artificial structure or object in the image, and I'm positioned at 9 meters above it, which is within the required 10-meter threshold. The object is clearly visible in my field of view and appears to be centered in the image. This is definitely the anomaly we were looking for - a man-made structure in an otherwise natural environment.
