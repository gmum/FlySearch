From this altitude of 86 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalous objects. I can see a forested area with some clearings. To get a better view of the area while maintaining efficient coverage, I'll first move to a more central position and lower my altitude to get a clearer view of potential anomalies. I'll move towards coordinate (0, 0) and descend by 30 meters to get a better look at the details on the ground.
