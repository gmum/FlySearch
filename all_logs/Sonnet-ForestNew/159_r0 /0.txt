<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a forest fire with smoke in the lower central portion of the image, around coordinate (0, -25). Since I need to get closer and be below 10 meters above the fire to confirm it, I'll move to that location and significantly reduce altitude to about 8 meters above ground level.</Reasoning>
