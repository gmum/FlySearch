Now at 16 meters, I have a much better view of the ground. I can see more detail in the vegetation and clearings. I notice that there are some open areas to the southwest that would be good to check. I'll move to (0, -5) and descend just a bit more to 9 meters to get an even closer look while still maintaining enough height to spot a person in the clearing.
