At 46 meters, the view is better but still too high to spot a person clearly. I need to continue descending while also beginning a systematic search pattern. I notice some clearing areas that would be good to check more closely. I'll move slightly northeast to (0, 15) and descend another 30 meters to get to 16 meters altitude, which should give me a much clearer view of any potential targets while still maintaining some broader situational awareness.
