I notice something of interest in the area around (0, 9) that needs closer inspection. I'll move to that position and lower the altitude by another 18 meters to get closer to the required height of less than 10 meters. This will put me at approximately 9 meters above ground level, which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters if we find our target.
