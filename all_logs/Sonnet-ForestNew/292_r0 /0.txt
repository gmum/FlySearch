<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a blue circular object near the center-top portion of the image, around coordinates (0, 26). This seems to be the anomaly we're looking for as it stands out against the natural green and brown terrain. I'll move to that position and decrease altitude significantly to get closer to the object, aiming to get below 10 meters above it.</Reasoning>
