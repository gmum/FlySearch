I can now clearly see what appears to be a small clearing or campsite area. I'm already at a good altitude of 9 meters, which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters. The drone is positioned centrally over the area of interest, and I have a clear view of what appears to be the campsite in the clearing. Since I'm at the correct position and altitude (below 10m), with the target in view, I can confirm the finding.
