FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now positioned at an ideal altitude of 7 meters above a clearly artificial structure that appears to be made of concrete or similar material. This object stands out distinctly from the natural environment of vegetation and terrain. It is well-centered in my field of view and I am well within the required 10-meter altitude threshold for positive identification.
