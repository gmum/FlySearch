From this initial altitude of 53 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies. The image shows mostly natural terrain with vegetation. To get a better view while maintaining decent coverage, I'll move to a more central position (0,0) and reduce altitude to about 30 meters first. This will give me a better view of potential objects while still maintaining good visibility of the surrounding area.
