I can now clearly see what appears to be a light-colored artificial object or structure among the natural vegetation at approximately (5,0). It stands out significantly from the surrounding green vegetation and natural terrain. I'll move closer to it and lower my altitude to 8 meters to ensure I'm within the required 10-meter threshold while keeping it centered in my field of view.
