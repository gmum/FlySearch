From this lower altitude of 49 meters, I can see more details but still need to get closer to the ground to spot any anomalies. I notice what appears to be something different in the lower left quadrant of the image, near coordinates (-33, -16). I'll move in that direction and descend further to about 25 meters to get a better look.
