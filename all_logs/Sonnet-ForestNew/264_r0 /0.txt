I need to start a systematic search for any anomalies in the environment. From this height of 97 meters, I can see a good portion of the area, but it's still too high to spot small details. I'll move to a lower altitude while positioning myself at a central location to get a better view. I'll descend to about 50 meters and move slightly towards the center of the grid at (32, 32).
