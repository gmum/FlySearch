I am currently at 8 meters altitude which is good (below 10 meters as required), but I need to move slightly to get a better view of the building structure. I can see it's a bit to my right and down, around coordinates (-3, -3). I'll maintain the same altitude since it's already optimal and just adjust my position to center on the building.
