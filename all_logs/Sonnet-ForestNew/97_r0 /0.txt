From my current position at 91 meters altitude, I can see a fairly wide area but need to get lower to better identify potential buildings. I notice what appears to be a brownish structure or area near the center of the image around coordinates (0, 0). To investigate this more closely, I'll move to that position and reduce altitude by 40 meters to get a better view while still maintaining enough height to keep good visibility.
