I can now see a building structure more clearly in the lower-left portion of the image, around coordinates (-33, -17). I need to move to that location and reduce altitude further to get below 10 meters as required. I'll descend by 42 meters to get to approximately 8 meters above ground level, which will satisfy the requirement of being below 10 meters.
