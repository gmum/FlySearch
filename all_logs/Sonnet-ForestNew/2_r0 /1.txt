<Reasoning>I can now see the forest fire clearly at the bottom of the image. I need to move slightly closer to the center of the fire, which appears to be around coordinates (2, -5). Since I'm already at a good altitude of 7 meters (which is below the required 10 meters), I'll maintain this height while moving to center over the fire.</Reasoning>
