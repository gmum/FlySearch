<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a building or structure near coordinates (0, 24). I'll move to that position and lower my altitude to get a better view of the potential target. Since I need to be below 10 meters to confirm the target, I'll descend by about 65 meters, which will put me at approximately 6 meters above ground level.</Reasoning>
