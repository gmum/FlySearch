I can see a clearing that might contain a campsite around coordinates (19, -19). Since I need to perform a careful search and get closer to confirm, I'll move towards that location while also descending to get a better view. I'll reduce altitude by 30 meters to get closer to the target while still maintaining enough height to scan the area effectively.
