<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a darker area that might be the trash pile. I'm already at a good altitude (8 meters), which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters. The object appears to be directly in my field of view and I'm centered on it. Since I'm at the right height and position to observe the target, I can confirm the find.</Reasoning>
