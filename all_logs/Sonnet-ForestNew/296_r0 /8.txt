I can now see a distinct metallic or artificial structure in the bottom left portion of the image, near coordinate (-5, -5). It appears to be some kind of metallic debris or man-made object that clearly doesn't belong in this natural environment. Since I'm already at 8 meters altitude, which is below our 10-meter requirement, and I have a clear view of the anomalous object, I can confirm this is our target.
