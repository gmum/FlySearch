From this aerial view, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies in the environment. The image shows mostly natural terrain with trees and grass. I'll start by moving forward (north) and lowering my altitude to get a better view of the area, as any anomalous object would be easier to spot from a lower height. I'll maintain a position that still gives me good visibility while getting closer to the ground.
