<Reasoning>I need to start a systematic search for any anomalies in the environment. From this altitude, I can see a good portion of the area, but I need to get lower to better identify any potential objects of interest. I'll move to the center point (0, 0) and decrease altitude to get a better view of the surroundings.</Reasoning>
