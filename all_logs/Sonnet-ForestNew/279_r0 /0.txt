From this altitude of 89 meters, I can see a general overview of the area. The terrain appears to be mostly grassland with scattered trees and vegetation. To effectively search for anomalies, I should:
1. Lower my altitude to get a better view of potential objects
2. Move to a central position to maximize my search coverage
3. I'll start by moving to (0,0) which is the center point and lower my altitude by 40 meters to get a better view while still maintaining good coverage area.
