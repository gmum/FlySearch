I can now clearly see what appears to be a gray concrete or stone structure near coordinates (0, -5). It's definitely an artificial object that doesn't match the natural environment. I am:
1. Currently at 7 meters altitude, which is within our required 10-meter threshold
2. Need to center directly over the object
3. Will move to position (0, -5) while maintaining current altitude
