From this lower altitude of 48 meters, I can see more details of the terrain. I notice what appears to be a light-colored object or rock near coordinates (16, 0). I should:
1. Move closer to that position to investigate
2. Lower my altitude further to get a better view
3. I'll reduce altitude by 30 meters while moving to those coordinates to get a much closer look at what might be our anomaly
