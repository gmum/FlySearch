FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now:
1. Directly centered over what appears to be a concrete or stone structure
2. At 6 meters altitude, which is well within our required 10-meter threshold
3. The anomalous object is clearly visible in my field of view
4. The object is clearly artificial and stands out from the natural environment
This meets all our criteria for declaring the object as found.
