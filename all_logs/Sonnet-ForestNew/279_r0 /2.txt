At 17 meters altitude, I can now see a distinctive light-colored object that appears to be artificial near coordinates (6, 0). It stands out against the natural vegetation and appears to be our target anomaly. I should:
1. Move directly above it
2. Lower my altitude to get within 10 meters as required
3. Center myself over the object at coordinates (6, 0) and descend to 8 meters to ensure I'm well within the 10-meter requirement
