From this height and initial position, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies in the environment. The image shows mostly natural vegetation with some variations in color. To get a better view, I should first lower my altitude while staying centered, which will give me a closer look at the area directly below. I'll descend by 40 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining my position.
