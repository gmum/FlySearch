I can now see what appears to be a distinct dark area that stands out from the natural vegetation pattern. It looks like an artificial or unusual formation in the environment. I'm getting closer but need to descend a bit more to get below 10 meters and ensure I'm properly centered over this anomaly. I'll make a small adjustment to center better and lower my altitude further.
