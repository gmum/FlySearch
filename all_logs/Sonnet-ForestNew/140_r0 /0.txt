I can see what appears to be a blue object that might be part of a campsite near coordinates (0, 0). Since my objective requires me to get closer and lower to confirm, I'll move to that position and decrease altitude to about 8 meters to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining a safe distance from the ground.
