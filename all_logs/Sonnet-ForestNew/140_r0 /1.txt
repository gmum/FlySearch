I can now clearly see what appears to be a blue tent or camping equipment at my current position. I'm already at 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and I'm centered on the target. Since I have a clear view of the campsite and meet all the requirements (below 10m, centered, and object in field of view), I can confirm the finding.
