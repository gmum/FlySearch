<Reasoning>
I now have a clear view of the large boulder/rock which is definitely the anomalous object in this grassy environment. I am currently:
1. Centered on the object
2. At 6 meters altitude, which is well below the required 10 meters
3. Have the object clearly in my field of view

These conditions satisfy all requirements for completing the mission.
