From this initial aerial view at 67 meters, I can see a mostly green landscape with some trees and vegetation. To effectively search for any anomalous objects, I should:
1. Lower my altitude to get a better view of the ground
2. Move systematically through the grid to ensure thorough coverage
3. Start with the central area and work outward

I'll begin by descending to about 30 meters while staying in the center position to get a better overview of the immediate area.
