At 29 meters altitude, I have a clearer view but still need to systematically search the area. I notice nothing unusual in the current central position. I should explore the right side of the grid (positive x coordinates) since the left side is partially obscured by the aircraft. I'll move slightly to the east while maintaining this altitude to begin searching that area.
