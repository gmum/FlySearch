I can now see more detail at 40 meters altitude. I notice what appears to be a small dark figure or object in the lower portion of the image, around coordinates (0, -13). I'll move to that position and lower my altitude significantly to get a much closer look, reducing height by 30 meters to get within the required 10-meter range.
