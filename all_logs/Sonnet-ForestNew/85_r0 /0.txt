From this altitude of 70 meters, I can see a wide area but need to get closer to search for the person effectively. I notice a few structures or dark spots in the middle region that might be worth investigating. I'll move to a central position and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area around (0, 0) coordinates.

First, I'll position myself at the center coordinates and reduce altitude by 30 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue searching if needed.
