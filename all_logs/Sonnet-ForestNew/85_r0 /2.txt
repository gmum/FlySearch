FOUND

<Reasoning>
I can now clearly see the person directly below the drone at coordinates (0, -7). I am at 10 meters altitude which meets the requirement of being at or below 10 meters above the object. The person is centered in my field of view, so I can confirm the target has been located under the specified conditions.
