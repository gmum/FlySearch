<Reasoning>I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. From this altitude, I can see a large area but might miss smaller details. I notice some patches that look different from the natural vegetation, particularly near the center of the image. I'll move towards the center coordinates (0,0) and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area.</Reasoning>
