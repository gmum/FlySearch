<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the yellow flowering vegetation which is definitely our anomaly. I'm at 17 meters altitude, and I need to get below 10 meters while staying centered over the anomaly. I'll descend 8 more meters to get to 9 meters altitude, which will put me safely below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining visual contact with the anomaly.</Reasoning>
