I can now see the two dark tent-like structures clearly in my field of view. I'm at 8 meters altitude which is within the required range (below 10 meters), and the campsite is centered in my view. This meets all the requirements: the object is in my field of view, I'm centered on it, and I'm below 10 meters altitude.
