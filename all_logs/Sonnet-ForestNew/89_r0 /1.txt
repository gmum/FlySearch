I can now see what appears to be some dark rectangular shapes in the lower portion of the image, which could be tents or camping equipment. I'll move slightly south towards these objects at coordinates (0, -15) and descend another 30 meters to get a closer look. This should help confirm if these are indeed the campsite structures I'm looking for.
