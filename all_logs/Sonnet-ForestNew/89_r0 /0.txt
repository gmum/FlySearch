I need to conduct a methodical search for the campsite. From this altitude of 77 meters, I can see a large area but might miss smaller details. I notice some clearings in the wooded area that could potentially contain a campsite. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) and descend 30 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively.
