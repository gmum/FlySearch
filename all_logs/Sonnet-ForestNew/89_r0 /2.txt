I can now see what appears to be the campsite more clearly in my field of view. I'm at 16 meters altitude which is still too high according to the objective (needs to be below 10 meters). I'll descend another 8 meters to get to 8 meters altitude while maintaining my current horizontal position. This will put me at the required height of less than 10 meters above the target while keeping it centered in my field of view.
