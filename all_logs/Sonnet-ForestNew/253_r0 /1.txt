<Reasoning>
I can now see what appears to be an artificial structure or object more clearly around coordinates (-14, -14). It looks metallic or grey in color and seems out of place in the natural environment. I'll move to those coordinates and decrease altitude further to get within 10 meters of it for a closer inspection.
