I need to conduct a systematic search of the area to find any anomalies. From this height (65m), I can see a good portion of the terrain, but details might be hard to spot. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view. Looking at the image, I'll move towards coordinate (0, 0) which is in the center, and reduce height by 25 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough altitude to continue searching effectively.
