<Reasoning>
From this position, I can see what appears to be an anomaly near coordinates (-7, -7) in the lower left corner. There's something that looks distinctly different from the natural vegetation patterns. I'll move closer to investigate while maintaining this low altitude of 10 meters, which is perfect for final confirmation.
