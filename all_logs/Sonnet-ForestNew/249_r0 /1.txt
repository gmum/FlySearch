From this lower altitude (40m), I can see more details. I notice something that looks unusual in the lower left quadrant of the image, near coordinates (-27, -13). It appears to be different from the natural vegetation patterns. I'll move towards that position and reduce altitude further to investigate this potential anomaly more closely.
