At this lower altitude of 39 meters, I can see the terrain more clearly. I notice something that looks like a light-colored patch or potential trash pile near coordinates (-26, -26) in the lower left portion of the image. I'll move towards that location and lower my altitude further to get a better look at what appears to be different from the surrounding vegetation.
