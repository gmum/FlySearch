I can see what appears to be some disturbed ground or potential trash near coordinates (-12, -12) in the lower left area. At 18 meters altitude, I'm getting closer but still need to get lower to confirm if this is the trash pile we're looking for. I'll move slightly towards it and lower my altitude to get below 10 meters for a clear confirmation.
