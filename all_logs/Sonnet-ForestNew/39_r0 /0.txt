<Reasoning>
From this altitude of 89 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. I can see a relatively open area, but the altitude is too high to identify small objects clearly. I'll start by moving to the center coordinates (0, 0) and lowering my altitude significantly to get a better view of the ground. This will give me a good central position to start the search and better visibility of potential objects.
