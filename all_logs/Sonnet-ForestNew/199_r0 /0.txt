I can see what appears to be a grey building or structure in the lower left quadrant of the image, around coordinates (-35, -35). Since I need to be below 10 meters to properly identify it, I'll move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude to about 8 meters to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining a safe height.
