I can now see what appears to be the concrete or stone structure more clearly. Since I'm already at a good altitude of 2 meters (well below the required 10 meters) and I can see the building in my field of view, I should center myself over it. I'll move slightly to (-1, -1) to get a better central position over the structure.
