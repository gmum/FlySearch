From this altitude and initial position, I can see a general overview of the area but need to conduct a systematic search to find the trash pile. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering the altitude to get a better view of the terrain. I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) and reduce altitude by 20 meters to get a clearer view while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively.
