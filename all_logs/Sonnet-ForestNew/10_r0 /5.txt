<Reasoning>
I need to be systematic in my search. I notice something unusual near coordinates (-8, 0) in the western part of the image - there appears to be a darker patch that looks different from the natural vegetation patterns we've been seeing. Since we're already at a good altitude (12m, which is below our 10m requirement for identification), I'll move to investigate that area while maintaining this height.</Reasoning>
