<Reasoning>
I notice what appears to be a darker area in the northwest quadrant of the image, around coordinates (37, 19). This could potentially be the trash pile we're looking for. I should:
1. Move closer to that location
2. Lower my altitude further to get a better view
3. Position myself directly above the suspicious area

I'll move to (37, 19) and descend another 40 meters to get a clearer view of this area.</Reasoning>
