<Reasoning>
I can see scattered vegetation and terrain, but no clear trash pile from this height. I need to:
1. Lower my altitude to get a better view
2. Move towards the center of the grid initially to have a good vantage point
3. Maintain enough height to still have a good field of view for searching

I'll move to coordinate (0, 0) which is the center point and lower my altitude by about 40 meters to get a better view while still maintaining good coverage area.</Reasoning>
