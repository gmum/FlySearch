I notice what appears to be a darker spot near coordinates (-9, -9) in the lower left section of the image. It looks different from the vegetation patterns we've seen. Since I'm already at a good altitude (14m), I'll move to investigate that area while maintaining this height. This altitude is perfect as it's below our 10m requirement for identifying the target.</Reasoning>
