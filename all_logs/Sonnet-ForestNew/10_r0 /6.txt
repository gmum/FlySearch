<Reasoning>
I can see that what I thought might be the trash pile was actually just more vegetation. I notice a different kind of patch or disturbance near (-7, -4) in the southwestern portion of the image. Since we're at 11m altitude, which is still slightly higher than ideal for our target identification (needs to be under 10m), I'll move to that location and descend slightly to get under the 10m requirement.</Reasoning>
