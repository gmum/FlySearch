From this lower altitude, I can see I was mistaken about the previous dark area - it was likely just vegetation. I need to continue my systematic search. I notice this is a different section of the area with smaller grid coordinates. At this low altitude (15m), I should be able to clearly see a trash pile if it's in view. I'll move to the center of this new grid section and stay at this height since it gives good visibility while being under 10m from ground objects.</Reasoning>
