I notice a distinct patch near coordinates (-5, -2) that appears different from the natural vegetation patterns - it has a more irregular, artificial appearance that could be a trash pile. We're at 7 meters altitude which is excellent for identification (well below our 10m requirement). I'll move directly over this suspicious area for final confirmation.</Reasoning>
