I notice there's something that looks different from the natural vegetation near (-5, -5) in the southwestern area - it appears to have a different texture and color pattern than the surrounding vegetation. We're now at 8 meters altitude, which is perfect for our requirements (below 10m). I'll move to investigate this area while maintaining this height.</Reasoning>
