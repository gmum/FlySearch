I see I was mistaken about the previous spot - it was just more vegetation. I notice there's a pattern of vegetation and natural terrain, but no clear trash pile yet. Since we're systematically searching, I'll move to investigate the northeastern quadrant of our search area while maintaining this good altitude (13m which is perfect for our requirements). I'll head towards (9, 4) where there seems to be some different coloration that needs investigation.</Reasoning>
