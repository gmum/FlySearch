<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a red/orange spot near coordinates (29, 0) which could be the forest fire we're looking for. I'll move directly to those coordinates and descend significantly to get a closer look. I'll drop down to about 8 meters above ground level to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining a safe distance from the ground.</Reasoning>
