<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the forest fire in my field of view. I'm already at 7 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters, and I'm centered well enough to observe the fire. This position meets all the requirements: the fire is in view, I'm below 10 meters altitude, and I'm centered on the target.</Reasoning>
