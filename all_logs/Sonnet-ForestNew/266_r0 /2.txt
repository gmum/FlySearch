I can now see what appears to be an anomaly - there's a fallen tree or branches arranged in an unusual pattern near the center of the image. This definitely looks out of place compared to the surrounding natural vegetation. I'll move closer to the center of this pattern and lower my altitude to get within 10 meters of it.
