From this lower altitude of 42 meters, I can see the terrain more clearly. I notice something that could be of interest near coordinates (-14, 14) - there seems to be a slight difference in the pattern of vegetation. I'll move to that location and lower the altitude further to get a better look at what might be an anomaly.
