From this initial position and altitude of 39 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search. I notice various patches of vegetation and open areas. To get a better view and start the search effectively, I should first lower my altitude to about 20 meters and move slightly to get a clearer view of the central area. I'll move towards (0, 0) and reduce altitude by 19 meters to get a closer look.
