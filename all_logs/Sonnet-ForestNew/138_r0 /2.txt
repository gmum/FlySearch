<Reasoning>The building is now clearly visible at the bottom of my view. I need to move slightly back to center it in my field of view. I'm currently at a good altitude of 7 meters, which is below the required 10 meters. I'll move to (0, -2) to center the building in my view while maintaining the same altitude.</Reasoning>
