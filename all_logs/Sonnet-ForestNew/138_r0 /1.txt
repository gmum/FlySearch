<Reasoning>I can now see the building more clearly. It appears to be directly ahead of my position, just slightly above center. I need to descend further to get below 10 meters above it. I'll move slightly forward to (0, 15) to center it better and descend by 38 meters, which should put me at approximately 8 meters above the building.</Reasoning>
