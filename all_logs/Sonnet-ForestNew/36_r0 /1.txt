From this lower altitude of 45 meters, I can see more detail but still no clear sign of the person. There appears to be some interesting areas near the (15, 15) coordinate where there's a patch of different vegetation. I'll move there and further reduce altitude by 25 meters to get an even closer look while still maintaining enough height to keep a reasonable search area in view.
