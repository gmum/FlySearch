<Reasoning>
I'm now at a very low altitude (4 meters) above what appears to be a large reflective or metallic disc structure embedded in the ground. This is clearly an anomalous object that doesn't fit with the natural environment. I'm already below 10 meters and centered on the object, so this meets all the criteria for reporting the find.
