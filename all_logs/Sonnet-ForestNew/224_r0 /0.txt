I can see what appears to be a blue circular object in the center of the image, possibly a pool or water feature. Since I need to get closer to any potential anomalies to inspect them, I'll move directly above this object and lower my altitude to get a better look. The object is roughly at coordinates (0, 0), and I want to get below 10 meters to properly inspect it.
