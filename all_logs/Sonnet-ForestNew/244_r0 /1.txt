I can now clearly see what appears to be a white linear object, likely a pole or similar structure, which is definitely the anomaly we're looking for. I'm already at a good altitude (8 meters, which is below our 10-meter requirement) and I'm centered on the object in my field of view. Since I'm at the right position and altitude, and the object is clearly visible, I can confirm the find.
