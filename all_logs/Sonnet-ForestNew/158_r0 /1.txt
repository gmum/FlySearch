At this lower altitude of 29 meters, I can see more details of the terrain. I notice something that looks like a structure or debris in the upper portion of the image. I'll move towards the coordinates (0, 19) to investigate that area more closely, while also descending further to get a better view. I'll reduce altitude by another 15 meters to get closer to the target height range.
