I can now clearly see what appears to be the trash pile or debris near some structures at coordinates (0, 9). I'm currently at 14 meters altitude, which is still a bit high for our target of being below 10 meters. I'll position directly over the debris and descend by 6 meters, which will put me at 8 meters altitude - well within our target range of being below 10 meters while keeping the object in view.
