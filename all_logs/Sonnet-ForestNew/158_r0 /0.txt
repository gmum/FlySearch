From this altitude of 81 meters, I can see a good portion of the area but might miss smaller details like a trash pile. I notice mostly vegetation and some bare patches. To conduct an effective search, I should first lower my altitude significantly to get a better view of the ground details, while staying in a central position. I'll descend to about 30 meters altitude first, which will give me a much better view while still maintaining a decent search area.
