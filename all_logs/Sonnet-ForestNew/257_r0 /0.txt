<Reasoning>
From this height and initial position, I need to conduct a systematic search. The image shows a forest area with dense vegetation. I'll start by moving to a central position and lowering the altitude to get a better view of the area. I'll move to coordinates (0, 26) and descend by 30 meters to improve visibility while maintaining enough height to continue searching effectively.
