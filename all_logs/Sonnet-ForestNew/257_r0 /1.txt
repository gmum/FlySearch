From this lower altitude, I can see more details but still no clear anomaly. I notice some variations in the forest density. I'll continue my search by moving to the western section (negative x coordinates) and descend further to get an even better view. I'll move to (-16, 16) and lower the altitude by another 20 meters to improve visibility while still maintaining enough height to maneuver safely.
