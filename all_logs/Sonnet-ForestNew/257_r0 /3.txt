<Reasoning>
I can now clearly see a metallic/reflective circular object that appears to be artificial and doesn't belong in this forest environment. I am already positioned at a good altitude (8 meters) which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view. This matches all the requirements for identifying the anomaly.
