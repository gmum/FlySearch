<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a dark green tent or campsite near coordinates (-26, 0). I should move closer to that location and decrease altitude to get a better view and verify if it's indeed the target. I'll move directly to those coordinates and descend by 30 meters to get closer to the required height.</Reasoning>
