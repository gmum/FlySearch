I can now see what appears to be a small grey/white anomaly near the center of the image, around coordinates (0, 0). This object stands out from the natural green vegetation and brown soil. Since I'm at 15 meters altitude and need to be below 10 meters to confirm the finding, I'll move to center directly above it and lower my altitude to 8 meters.
