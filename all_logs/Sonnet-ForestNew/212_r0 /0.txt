I notice the terrain is mostly green with some scattered vegetation. To effectively search for any anomalies, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while maintaining a position that gives me good coverage. I'll move to the center position (0,0) and reduce altitude by 40 meters to get a clearer view of the surroundings.
