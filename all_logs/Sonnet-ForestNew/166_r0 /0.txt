<Reasoning>I can see a building structure near the center of the image. Since I'm currently at 40 meters altitude and need to be below 10 meters to properly identify it, I'll move to the building's location (slightly north of center) and reduce my altitude significantly. I'll aim for 8 meters altitude to ensure I'm below the 10-meter requirement while maintaining a safe distance from the ground.</Reasoning>
