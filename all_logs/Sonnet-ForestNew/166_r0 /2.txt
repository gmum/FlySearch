<Reasoning>I can now clearly see the building structure in my field of view. I am at 6 meters altitude, which is well below the required 10 meters, and the building is centered in my view. This meets all the requirements: the object is in view, I am below 10 meters altitude, and I am centered on the target.</Reasoning>
