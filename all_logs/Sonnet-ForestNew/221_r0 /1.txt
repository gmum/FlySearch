FOUND

<Reasoning>
I can clearly see the anomalous object - what appears to be a large artificial or mechanical crab-like structure on the ground. I am currently positioned at a good altitude (8 meters above ground level) which is below the required 10 meters, and the object is clearly in my field of view. The object is well-centered in the frame, so this is an optimal position to declare that I've found the target.
