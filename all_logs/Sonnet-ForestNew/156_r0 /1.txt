Now at 18 meters altitude, I have a clearer view of the area. I can see more detail in the vegetation and clearings. I notice what appears to be movement or an object in the clearing towards the northeast direction. I'll move to (6, 6) and lower my altitude slightly to get a better view of that area. I'm keeping the altitude change modest since I'm already relatively low and need to maintain visual contact.
