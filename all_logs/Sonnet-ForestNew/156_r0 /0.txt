From this aerial view at 48 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search. I notice a mix of vegetation and clearings in the area. To start the search effectively, I'll move to a central position and lower my altitude to get a better view of the ground. I'll head to coordinates (0, 0) which is in the center of the visible area and decrease altitude by 30 meters to get a closer look at the terrain.
