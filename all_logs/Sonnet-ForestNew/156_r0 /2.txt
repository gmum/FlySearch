I can now see someone in the clearing near coordinates (3, 6). I'm currently at 9 meters altitude, which is within our target range of being below 10 meters. The person is clearly visible in my field of view, and I'm close enough to confirm their presence. Since I'm both centered on the target and at the correct altitude, I can confirm the find.
