<Reasoning>I apologize for my previous aggressive maneuver. The aircraft itself is not the anomaly we're looking for - it would be dangerous to get that close to an aircraft. Let me move away from the aircraft to continue searching for actual anomalies in the environment. I'll move to (-8, 8) to check the northwestern area while maintaining my current altitude.</Reasoning>
