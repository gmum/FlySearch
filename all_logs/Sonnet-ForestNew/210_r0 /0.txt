<Reasoning>I can see a commercial aircraft in the center of the image, which appears to be the anomaly in this natural environment. Since I need to get below 10 meters relative to the object and need to be centered on it, I'll move to the aircraft's position (14, 0) and decrease my altitude significantly to get closer to it. I'll aim for about 8 meters above it to ensure I'm within the required range while maintaining a safe distance.</Reasoning>
