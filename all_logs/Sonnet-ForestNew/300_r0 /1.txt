<Reasoning>
I can now clearly see the anomalous object - what appears to be a large metallic or artificial structure in the landscape. I am currently at 9 meters above ground level, which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters, and the object is directly in my field of view. The position is optimal for observation of the anomaly.
