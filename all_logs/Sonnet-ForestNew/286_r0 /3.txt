<Reasoning>
I am now positioned directly above a patch of yellow flowers at a good altitude of 8 meters, which is below the required 10 meters. This yellow patch clearly stands out as an anomaly against the green grass and grey rocks of the natural environment. I am centered on the object and it's clearly in my field of view.
