I can now clearly see a circular metallic or reflective object that appears to be the anomaly we're looking for. I'm currently at 8 meters altitude, which is within our target range of being below 10 meters. The object is perfectly centered in my field of view. This matches all our criteria: the object is clearly visible, I'm centered on it, and I'm below 10 meters altitude.
