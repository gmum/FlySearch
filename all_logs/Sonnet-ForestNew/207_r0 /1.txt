<Reasoning>
From this lower altitude of 38 meters, I can see the terrain more clearly. I notice there might be something unusual near the (-13, -13) coordinates - there appears to be a slightly different coloration or pattern in that area. I'll move to that position and lower my altitude further to investigate more closely.
