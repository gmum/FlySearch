From my current position at 58 meters altitude, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies. I notice that the terrain is mostly natural vegetation with trees and grass. For an efficient search, I should first lower my altitude to get a better view while moving towards the center of the grid to maximize my field of view. I'll move to coordinate (0,0) and reduce altitude by 20 meters to get a clearer view of the area.
