<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a tent or small campsite near the center of the image. To get a better view and position myself correctly, I'll move to coordinates (0, 0) which appear to be directly above the campsite. Since I need to be below 10 meters to confirm the target, I'll also decrease my altitude by 25 meters, bringing me to approximately 7 meters above ground level.</Reasoning>
