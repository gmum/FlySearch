<Reasoning>I apologize for my previous aggressive descent. I'm currently at 9 meters above ground level, which is actually within our target range (below 10 meters). I can see the aircraft clearly, and I'm positioned well above it. Since I'm already at the correct height and positioned correctly over the anomalous object (the airplane), I can confirm the find.</Reasoning>
