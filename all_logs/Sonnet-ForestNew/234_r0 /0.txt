<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be an airplane on the ground, which is definitely an anomaly in this natural environment. It's located near the center of the image. Since I need to get closer to it and be below 10 meters above it, I'll move to position (0, 0) and significantly decrease my altitude to get a closer look. I'll descend by 70 meters to get to approximately 7 meters above the aircraft.</Reasoning>
