<Reasoning>I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. From my current altitude of 55 meters, I can see a good portion of the terrain but might miss smaller details. I'll start by moving to a central position at (18, 0) and reducing altitude to get a better view of the area. This will give me a good vantage point to start my detailed search while maintaining enough height to still see a reasonable area.</Reasoning>
