<Reasoning>I can see more details now at 30 meters, but I need to continue my search. I notice some interesting areas near (10, 10) where there seems to be some movement or unusual pattern. I'll move to that position and lower my altitude further to get a clearer view, but not too low yet in case I need to adjust my position further.</Reasoning>
