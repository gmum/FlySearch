<Reasoning>At this lower altitude, I can see more detail in the area. I notice something that looks like a small clearing or anomaly slightly to the east and south of my current position, around (4, -4). I'll move there and lower my altitude just a bit more to get a clear view while staying under 10 meters.</Reasoning>
