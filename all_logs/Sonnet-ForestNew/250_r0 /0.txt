<Reasoning>I need to start a systematic search for any anomalies in this forested area. The image shows a natural forest environment from above. I'll move to the center of the grid (0,0) and lower my altitude to get a better view of the area. This will give me a good central position to start my search and better visibility of potential anomalies.</Reasoning>
