<Reasoning>
I am now directly above the forest fire at 7 meters altitude, which is below our required 10-meter threshold. The fire is clearly visible in my field of view, appearing as a bright orange area. I am centered well enough to observe it, and I'm at an appropriate altitude to confirm the target.
