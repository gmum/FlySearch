<Reasoning>
At 25 meters altitude, I have a clearer view but still don't see any obvious anomalies in this section. I notice some variations in vegetation but nothing that appears artificial or out of place. I should continue my systematic search by moving to the bottom right quadrant (17, -17) while maintaining this altitude which gives good visibility.
