Now at 50 meters altitude, I can see what appears to be a bright yellow-colored area of vegetation around (-33, 0). However, this looks like natural vegetation rather than an anomalous object. I should continue searching while getting lower to the ground for better visibility. I'll move towards the center-right area (17, 0) and descend further to get a better view of any potential anomalies.
