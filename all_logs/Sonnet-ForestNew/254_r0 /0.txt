From this initial position at 85 meters altitude, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalous objects. I notice there appears to be a small yellowish patch in the lower right quadrant of the image, near coordinates (67, 0). I'll move towards that area while descending to get a better look at what might be our target object.
