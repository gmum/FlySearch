I'm currently at a good altitude of 8 meters, which meets our requirement of being below 10 meters. The aircraft is still visible in my field of view, but I need to center myself better over it since I'm only seeing part of the wing. Based on what I can see of the aircraft's position, I should move slightly towards coordinates (3, -3) to get a better center position over the aircraft while maintaining my current altitude.
