I need to adjust my position again as I'm still not properly centered over the aircraft. Based on the image, I should move to coordinates (-3, -3) to better center myself over the aircraft's fuselage. I'll maintain my current altitude of 8 meters since it's already within our target range of being below 10 meters.
