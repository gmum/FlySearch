From this altitude of 95 meters, I need to conduct a systematic search for the trash pile. The image shows a fairly uniform terrain with some vegetation patches. I'll start by moving to the center point (0, 0) and descending to get a better view of the area. This will give me a central position to continue the search while getting closer to the ground to spot potential targets.
