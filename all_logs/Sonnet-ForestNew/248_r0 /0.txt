<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a dark circular object that seems out of place in the environment, located near coordinates (11, 11). It looks like a manufactured object in contrast to the natural surroundings. Since I need to get closer and below 10 meters to confirm this anomaly, I will move to those coordinates and significantly reduce altitude to about 8 meters.</Reasoning>
