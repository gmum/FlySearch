<Reasoning>
I am now perfectly centered over what appears to be a concrete or debris area that matches the description of the trash pile we're looking for. My current altitude is 7 meters, which is well within our requirement of being below 10 meters above the object. The object is clearly visible in my field of view and I am centered on it.
