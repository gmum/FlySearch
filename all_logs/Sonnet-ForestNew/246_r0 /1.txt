<Reasoning>From this lower altitude, I can see more details of the terrain. I notice what appears to be a white or light-colored object near coordinates (12, 0). This stands out from the natural green and brown colors of the forest and ground. I'll move to that location and descend further to investigate this potential anomaly more closely.</Reasoning>
