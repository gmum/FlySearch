<Reasoning>I can now clearly see what appears to be a light-colored circular or curved object near coordinates (3, -3) that seems artificial and doesn't match the natural environment. I'm already at a good altitude of 9 meters, which is within our target of being below 10 meters. I'll move to center directly over this anomaly.</Reasoning>
