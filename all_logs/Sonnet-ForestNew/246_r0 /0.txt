<Reasoning>I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies in this forested area. From this altitude, I can see a good portion of the area but might miss smaller objects. I'll start by moving to a central position and reducing altitude to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (22, 22) and descend by 30 meters to get a clearer view of the terrain while maintaining enough height to continue the search effectively.</Reasoning>
