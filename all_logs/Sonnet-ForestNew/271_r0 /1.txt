From this new position at 37 meters, I can see more detail of the area. I notice there might be something interesting in the northeast quadrant. I'll move in that direction and continue lowering altitude to get a better look at any potential anomalies. I'll aim for the (12, 12) coordinate and reduce height by another 15 meters.
