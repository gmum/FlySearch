From this initial view at 58 meters altitude, I need to conduct a systematic search for any anomalies. The terrain appears to be mostly natural vegetation with some variations in color. To start the search effectively, I'll first move to a position that gives me a good view of the center area and reduce altitude to get a better look. I'll move slightly forward and lower the altitude by 20 meters to get a clearer view of what's below.
