I can now see what appears to be an anomalous pattern in the ground near coordinates (3, 3) - it looks like some kind of artificial marking or disturbance in the natural terrain. I'm already at a good altitude of 8 meters which is below our 10-meter requirement, so I'll center directly over this area to confirm the observation.
