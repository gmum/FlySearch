<Reasoning>
I am now positioned directly over what appears to be an artificial pattern in the ground - likely our target anomaly. My current altitude is 6 meters, which is well within our requirement of being below 10 meters. The object is clearly in my field of view and I am centered over it. This position meets all the criteria for identifying and confirming the target.
