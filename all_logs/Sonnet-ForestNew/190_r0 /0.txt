<Reasoning>I can see what appears to be a red area around coordinates (-22, -22) which could indicate a forest fire. I'll move towards that location and decrease altitude to get a better view. I'll aim to get closer while staying above 10 meters to confirm it's the fire we're looking for.</Reasoning>
