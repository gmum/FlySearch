I can now see more clearly at this lower altitude. Looking around the image, I can see what appears to be someone in coordinates around (5, -5). Since I'm already at 15 meters altitude, which is close but still above our target of being under 10 meters, I'll move to center over that position and descend by 6 more meters to get below 10 meters altitude.
