I am now perfectly positioned above the trash pile at 8 meters altitude, which is below the required 10 meters. The trash pile is clearly visible in my field of view and I am centered above it. This meets all the mission requirements:
1. Below 10 meters (at 8 meters)
2. Object in field of view
3. Centered on the object
