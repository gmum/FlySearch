I can now clearly see a trash pile consisting of various debris near coordinates (-3, -3). I need to position myself directly above it and ensure I'm at the correct altitude to meet the mission requirements. I'm currently at 10 meters which is just at the maximum allowable height, but I'll descend slightly to ensure I'm definitively under 10 meters while staying centered over the trash pile.
