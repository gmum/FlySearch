<Reasoning>I need to be more careful. At 12 meters altitude and considering the height of a commercial aircraft (which is typically around 11-12 meters tall), I should be at a good position relative to the top of the aircraft. The object is clearly in view, I'm centered over it, and I should be within 10 meters relative to the top of the aircraft.</Reasoning>
