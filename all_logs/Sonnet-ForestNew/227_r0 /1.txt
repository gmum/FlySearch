<Reasoning>I was too aggressive with my descent. Since we're dealing with an aircraft, I need to be more cautious. I'm currently at 12 meters above ground level, which is still a bit too close. I should move back up slightly to maintain a safer distance while still staying under 10 meters relative to the top of the aircraft. Let me adjust my position to be centered and slightly higher.</Reasoning>
