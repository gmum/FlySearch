<Reasoning>I can see an airplane on the ground that appears to be the anomaly in this natural environment. It's located near the center of the image at coordinates (24, 0). Since I need to be below 10 meters above the object and centered on it, I'll move to those coordinates and descend to get a closer look.</Reasoning>
