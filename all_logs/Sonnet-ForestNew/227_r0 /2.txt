<Reasoning>I'm now at 16 meters altitude, but I'm well-centered over the aircraft. Since the aircraft is a large object, and I need to be below 10 meters relative to it, I need to make one final adjustment downward to get closer while still maintaining safe operations. I'll descend about 8 meters to get to a good observation height.</Reasoning>
