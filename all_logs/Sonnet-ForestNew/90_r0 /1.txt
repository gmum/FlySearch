From this lower altitude of 21 meters, I can see more detail in the terrain. I notice some areas that might be of interest towards the upper portion of the visible area. I'll move slightly north to (0, 7) and continue descending to get an even closer look at any potential trash piles in that area. I'll decrease altitude by another 12 meters to get closer to our target height of under 10 meters.
