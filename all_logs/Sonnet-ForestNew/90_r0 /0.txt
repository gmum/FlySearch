From this height of 42 meters, I can see a general overview of the area but need to conduct a systematic search. There appears to be some variation in the terrain with patches of vegetation and possibly disturbed ground. I'll start by moving to a more central position and decreasing altitude to get a better view of potential trash piles. Moving to coordinates (0, 0) and descending by 20 meters should give me a better vantage point while maintaining enough height to continue the search if needed.
