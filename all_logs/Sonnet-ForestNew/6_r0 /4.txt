From this higher vantage point, I can see what appears to be a potential trash pile or debris area near coordinates (-11, -11). It looks different from the natural rock formations we've seen before. I'll move to that location and descend to get a closer look, aiming for about 8 meters altitude for a clear view while staying under the 10-meter requirement.
