From this position, I can still only see rocks and natural formations, no trash pile. I need to explore a different area. From our original wider view, let me move to check the area near (-12, -12) where there appeared to be some different terrain patterns. To stay within safe bounds of my current view, I'll move to (-4, -4) first, while maintaining this good observation altitude.
