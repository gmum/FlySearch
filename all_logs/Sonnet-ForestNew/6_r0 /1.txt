From this lower altitude, I can see better, but I don't see the trash pile in this immediate area. I notice what appears to be some rocks or natural formations, but not the target I'm looking for. I should check another area. Let me move towards (0, -12) where there seemed to be some different-looking terrain in the previous view, while maintaining this good working altitude.
