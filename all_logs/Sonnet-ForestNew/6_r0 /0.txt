I can see what appears to be some scattered debris or a potential trash pile near the coordinates (12, 0). To confirm this and get a better view, I should move closer to that location and reduce altitude to get under 10 meters above the potential target. I'll move to those coordinates and descend by 27 meters, which will put me at 8 meters above ground level - within the required range if this is indeed the trash pile.
