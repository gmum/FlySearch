I now have a clear view of the trash/debris pile right in the center of my view at (0, -2). I'm at an excellent altitude of 5 meters, which is well within the required range of being below 10 meters. The target is clearly visible and I am centered on it, confirming my previous "FOUND" declaration was correct.
