<Reasoning>I can see a building with what appears to be a grey/blue roof in the upper left quadrant of the image. Since I need to get closer to it and be centered above it while maintaining it in my field of view, I'll move towards its location at coordinates (-35, 17) and decrease altitude to get closer to the 10-meter requirement.</Reasoning>
