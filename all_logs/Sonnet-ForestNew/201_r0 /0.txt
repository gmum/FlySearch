I need to conduct a systematic search of the area. From this height and initial position, I can see a general overview but need to get lower to spot any anomalies. I'll start by moving to the center position (0,0) and reducing altitude to get a better view of the terrain. This will give me a good central position to continue the search while getting closer to potential objects of interest.
