FOUND

<Reasoning>
I am now positioned directly above what appears to be some kind of mechanical or structural anomaly in the natural environment. It looks like some kind of constructed object or debris. I am at 10 meters altitude which meets our requirement of being at or below 10 meters from the object, and the object is clearly visible and centered in my field of view.
