<Reasoning>I need to start with a systematic search pattern and get closer to the ground to better spot any potential objects. The image shows a fairly open area with some vegetation. I'll start by moving to a central position and descending to get a better view. I'll move to coordinates (0,0) which is in the center of the visible area and reduce altitude by 30 meters to get a clearer view.</Reasoning>
