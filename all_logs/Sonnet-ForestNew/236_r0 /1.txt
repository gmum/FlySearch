<Reasoning>I am now at a good altitude (8 meters) and can see the blue circular object clearly. However, I need to move slightly to center myself better over the object as it appears to be partially cut off on the left side of the image. I'll move to (-3, 0) to better center myself over the anomaly while maintaining the same altitude.</Reasoning>
