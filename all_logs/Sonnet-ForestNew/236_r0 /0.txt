<Reasoning>I can see a blue circular object that appears to be an anomaly in the environment - it looks like a pool or some kind of artificial structure in the middle of a natural grassy/wooded area. Since I'm currently at 30 meters altitude and need to be below 10 meters to properly identify and confirm the object, I'll move down to 8 meters altitude while staying centered on the object at (0,0). This will put me well within the required 10-meter height requirement while maintaining visual contact with the anomaly.</Reasoning>
