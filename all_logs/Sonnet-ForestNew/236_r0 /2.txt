<Reasoning>Now I have a much better view of the anomaly - it appears to be a large circular water feature with what looks like a smaller circular structure within it. I am already at a good altitude (8 meters) and well-centered over the object. Since I have a clear view of the entire anomaly and am below the required 10-meter height requirement, I can confirm the finding.</Reasoning>
