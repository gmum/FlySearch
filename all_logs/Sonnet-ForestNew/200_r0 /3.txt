I am now perfectly positioned above the blue tent/campsite at coordinates (0, 0), and I'm at an altitude of 9 meters, which is below the required 10 meters. The target is clearly visible and centered in my field of view. All conditions for completing the task have been met:
1. Object is in field of view
2. Drone is centered above the object
3. Altitude is below 10 meters (at 9 meters)
